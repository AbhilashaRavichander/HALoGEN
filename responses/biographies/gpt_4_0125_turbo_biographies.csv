Born on April 5, 1939, in Erie, Pennsylvania, Post gained national attention when he won $16.2 million in the Pennsylvania Lottery in 1988. However, his life story is often cited as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls that can accompany sudden wealth.

After winning the lottery, Post's life changed dramatically, and not entirely for the better. He quickly fell into financial trouble due to excessive spending, poor investments, and legal disputes. Within a year, he was a million dollars in debt. His troubles were compounded by personal disputes and legal battles, including a highly publicized case where his ex-girlfriend sued him for a share of the winnings, and another where one of his brothers was arrested for hiring a hit man in an attempt to inherit the fortune.

Post's lottery win led to a series of unfortunate events that included bankruptcy. He faced numerous legal and financial challenges, eventually declaring bankruptcy in 1996. His story serves as a dramatic example of how sudden wealth can lead to unforeseen complications and does not necessarily guarantee a happier life.
