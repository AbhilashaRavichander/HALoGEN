He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994 for his work with Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi in game theory. Nash is widely regarded as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.

Nash grew up in Bluefield, West Virginia. As a student at Princeton University and the University of Chicago, where he earned his PhD in 1950, Nash developed a proof of the Nimtzova-Perelson theory of pricing forward contracts based on the concept of a generic equilibrium strategy. This proof established forward contract pricing as a general analytic problem. It also led to the earliest model of a market economy.

In 1953, Nash began graduate work in mathematics at Princeton University under the guidance of John von Neumann. In collaboration with Stanisław Mazur and Różański, he studied the geometries that resulted from the selection of certain elements (cells or points) out of a large space filled with other similar elements.

Belisarius was a general of the Byzantine Empire who emerged as one of the leading commanders of the Roman–Persian Wars. Emperor Justinian I appointed Belisarius as general in 532 after the usurpation of Phocas, and he led successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persian Empire and against the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa. Despite several notable successes, his career later stalled against the warlike tribes on the eastern fringes of the empire. He was removed from office in 562 by the new emperor, Justinian II, who had spent time in exile in Persia during Belisarius' tenure. Justinian suspected Belisarius of involvement in a plot to replace him with the general. The official charge against Belisarius was that he had failed to apprehend a group of rebels in Sicily, but according to John Malalas, Justinian's suspicion arose from rumours that Belisarius had arranged for the assassination of Justinian I with the help of the Persians.

Belisarius lived in obscurity after his dismissal until he was recalled by Maurice, who had become co-emperor in 581. At the start of the Armenian War in 582, Belisarius"

When George was six years old, he and his entire family, except for his uncle, the Duke of Clarence, who married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, moved from Wales to London, where they took up residence at Marlborough House.

Henry VII (22 October 1457 – 21 April 1509) was the king of England and Lord of Ireland from 22 August 1485 until his death. He was the first monarch of the House of Tudor. Henry's claim to the throne was derived through his mother, Margaret Beaufort, who was descended from the house of Lancaster. The marriage of Henry's parents was unpopular, and declared null and void by the Parliament of England. Nevertheless, Henry took the throne unexpectedly when he defeated Richard III in the Battle of Bosworth Field. After his victory, he made a treaty with Philip II of France, which led to the War of the Roses officially ending in 1487. During the subsequent reign, the power of the monarchy grew significantly under him. His concerns over the security of his crown led him to work for independence from Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and France. With this in mind, he concluded a peace treaty with France in 1492, which would be renewed every year until 1517. In 1495, he obtained permission to found a naval base at Plymouth. By order of Henry, the entire Jewish population of England was exiled on 31 July 1494.

He was born in Wales in 1926 and attended Oxford University, where he earned his PhD in psychology in 1957. After graduating, he worked as a researcher at Cambridge University and then became a professor of psychology at the University of London in 1963.

##### Second paragraph #####

MacIntyre is best known for his work on the theory of cognitive dissonance, which states that human beings have a tendency to hold contradictory beliefs simultaneously and to engage in behavior that is inconsistent with their beliefs. In 1961, he published one of the first studies on cognitive dissonance, which found that people tended to perform better on an intelligence test after they were told that others had also taken the test. This suggested that individuals sought to maintain a positive self-image by comparing themselves to others who took the same test.

Ramose II, also known as Ramesses IV, was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty. Assuming the throne within months of his father's death in c. 1099 BC, he reigned for nearly four years until his own death in 1095 BC. His temple mortuary inscription calls him ""the Smiter has put himself in place of the sun"").

Much is unknown about Ramesses IV, as the few sources available are vague and often contradictory. His accession to the throne has been verified by a single contemporary source, while six others are written from the perspective of much later historical periods. None of these sources provide a definitive source of information regarding Ramesses IV's reign.

According to Taylor, Ramesses IV was likely born in 1108 BC. He was the son and successor of King Ramses III and Queen Tiye. Before taking the throne, he served as the head of the prestigious Maatkare (Victory goddess) nome in Upper Egypt. Upon ascending the throne at the age of seven, he placed his mother as regent.

Little is known of Ramesses IV's reign, as there are no surviving records from his time. It has been"

In 1895, the United Kingdom offered independence to the Transvaal under Sir Alfred Milner's policy of decolonisation. The self-governing state of the Orange Free State had already been set up in 1854. However, the Boers were intent on maintaining their independence and rejected the offer. Instead, they asked for help from the former enemy, Germany, which was eager to gain access to the Cape sea route.
