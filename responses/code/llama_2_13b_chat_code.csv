"Write a Python program that utilizes modules, packages, and/or libraries to solve the problem: 'How can this code that does factorial to the user input be more optimized?' ","Sure! Here's a possible solution:

One way to optimize the code that calculates the factorial of a user input is to use the `math.factorial()` function from the `math` module. This function is more efficient than the recursive implementation you provided, as it uses a loop to calculate the factorial instead of recursively calling itself.

Here's an example of how you could modify your code to use the `math.factorial()` function:
