The largest of the gas giants, Jupiter is two and a half times larger than Earth. With an average radius of 74 million miles (119 million kilometers), it is the third largest object in the Solar System, behind Saturn and Uranus. The Great Red Spot is a persistent storm that has been observed for over 300 years, making it one of the longest-lived weather patterns on this planet.
Jupiter's strong gravitational field creates a region around the planet known as the magnetosphere, which shields the planet from high energy charged particles from space, such as cosmic rays. The magnetic field created by Jupiter is the strongest of all the planets in the Solar System, shielding the planet from harmful radiation.
At its core, Jupiter is a ball of hot, dense plasma, consisting of hydrogen and helium. This molten core is about the size of Earth and is surrounded by a thick layer of metallic hydrogen. There are also signs of a possible solid rocky core, but it is heavily buried by layers of hydrogen and helium.

The largest of the gas giants, Jupiter is two and a half times larger than all other planets in the solar system combined. With a diameter just shy of 140,000 km, Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth.
Jupiter is also the most massive planet in the solar system, weighing more than 318 times as much as Earth. This makes it the most dense as well, with a solidity similar to that of water.
Like Saturn, Jupiter has a faint ring system, thought to be composed of dust particles and debris from its own formation. Unlike Saturn's, however, Jupiter's rings are not clearly defined and visible to telescopes on Earth.
The atmosphere of Jupiter consists mostly of hydrogen and helium, making it a gas giant rather than a rocky planet like Earth. It may have a solid core of heavy elements, but scientists cannot determine this conclusively from observations currently.
Jupiter has no solid surface, known as the ""topside,"" but it does have an atmospheric layer, called the ""troposphere."" This extends from the top of the planet's cloudtops down to its solid surface of gaseous hydrogen and helium.

3rd rock from the Sun. One of the Solar System's smallest and most dense planet, it has a compact carbon-dioxide atmosphere that provides a low pressure at the planet's surface.[69] Mercury's relatively large iron core and thin mantle have produced a relatively high magnetic field—the third-strongest among the six known planets in the Solar System—although it is currently inactive.[70] This strong internal magnetism has long made researchers suspect that Mercury may also have a liquid core, and models suggest that it may be a homogeneous iron–nickel mix.[71] In 2006, images obtained by NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft revealed evidence of large-scale resurfacing on the"

Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is a terrestrial planet. It is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus itself. The Russian Venera 7 probe was the first spacecraft to land on Venus in 1967, but it failed after less than an hour after landing. Landing on Venus is difficult due to its extremely hot climate (surface temperature = 737 K or 464 °C, mean distance from the sun = 67.9 million km).
 ### Vulcan
Vulcan was a hypothetical inner planet of the Solar System during the 19th century. Its existence was postulated to explain observed phenomena such as the orbit of Uranus, which differed from those of the other major planets. The predicted planet was also intended to mitigate the gravitational perturbation caused by the then-unexplained ninth planet, Neptune, on the orbit of the then-known eight inner planets.
 ### Vesta
Vesta is a medium-sized rocky asteroid #[asteroid / in earth's orbit], the fourth largest asteroid in the main belt. NASA's Dawn space probe visited Vesta in 2011 and 2012, becoming the first spacecraft to visit a protoplanet discovered outside our solar system.[1] V"

Our planet, Earth, is the third planet from the sun. It is the only place in the universe known to have life. Earth has one moon, named ""Luna,"" which was discovered on this day in 1610 by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei.

### Mars

Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and the second smallest in our solar system. It is also the coldest of the planets, with surface temperatures dropping as low as -135 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite its harsh environment, scientists believe there could be water on Mars, hidden in ice or underground reserves.

### Jupiter

Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. It is also the most massive, with a diameter of more than 11 earths placed side-by-side. Jupiter is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium, and it has four large moons of its own: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

The largest and most massive of the ice dwarfs, Pluto is a frozen ball of ice and rock that appears to be two spherical sections connected by a narrow, icy band. It has a heart-shaped region called Sputnik Planitia located in its northern hemisphere.
Despite being only 73746 km wide, Pluto is known to have a surprisingly complex geological history shaped by internal heat and activity, including extensive surface features such as grooved mountains and glaciers. Its moon Charon is so large it creates a tidal bulge as it orbits, causing the planet to have a slightly egg-shaped appearance when seen from above.
In February 2006, a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown announced the discovery of another dwarf planet, named Eris.

Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is a celestial body moving around the Sun. It has the third-highest surface gravity in the Solar System, making it one of the most geologically active objects in the Solar System and causing its surface to be covered by volcanoes and craters.

Venus's atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, which makes up 96 percent of its mass, followed by nitrogen and oxygen. Its clouds consist mostly of sulfuric acid, or mist, creating an environment where life would be impossible. Compared to Earth, the Venusian atmosphere is extremely dense. The pressure at the bottom of the Venusian cloud layer is about 90 times greater than at sea level on Earth.

``` venus; the second planet from the Sun is the brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky. Also known as ""Earths Sister"" or ""The Morning Star"", it is one of the best studied planetary bodies in the solar system. Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, it is the hottest planet in the solar system, with a surface temperature of 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). The atmosphere of Venus is mostly carbon dioxide, which makes up about 96 percent of its mass, followed by nitrogen and oxygen, which account for 3.5 percent and 2 percent of the planet's mass, respectively.

Despite its name, Venus is not part of the Earth's solar neighborhood, but rather is a member of our neighboring region of the Milky Way galaxy, which includes the other two terrestrial-type planets in the inner solar system: Mercury and Mars. It has no natural satellites (moons) to speak of.

Our home planet, Earth, is the only place known to host life. It's the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the four terrestrial planets (the other three being Mercury, Venus, and Mars). Earth has one moon, named ""Luna,"" and is also part of a binary system with another small celestial body called ""Deimos"" orbiting around Mars.

### Mercury

Mercury, the smallest and closest to the sun, is the fastest moving planet in the Solar System. It has no moons. Because there is no tilt on its axis, there are no seasons. The temperature ranges from 800 °F (430 °C) to -279 °F (-173 °C) depending on your location on the planet.

### Venus

Venus is the second-closest to the sun and is sometimes referred to as the ""Morning Star."" It's covered in dense, yellow-colored clouds, making it difficult to see through them. However, it may have had water in its past. Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a surface temperature of 864°F (462°C).

Mercury, is the smallest terrestrial planet and closest to the Sun. The first human-made object to orbit Earth, and the first probe to land on another planet, Voyager 1, visited Mercury on March 29, 1975. After being fetched into an anti-Earth orbit by the Mariner 10 spacecraft in 1974, Voyager 1 took advantage of a close approach to Mercury to turn on its ultraviolet camera for only the second time in NASA's history to take pictures of the planet's never-before-seen auroras. These were the first images of Mercury taken from outside the atmosphere.

### Venus

Venus, the second planet from the sun, is also called the ""Morning Star"" or ""Evening Star"", it is the brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky (other than the moon), reaching as much as magnitude –4.6. This is about twice as bright as Sirius, the brightest star. Pale blue dots of cloud can be seen drifting across the disk in comparison to the reddish tint of the horizon. This is because Venus has a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere which causes it to block visible light strongly, while allowing infrared and other wavelengths through to reach Earth.

```
Mercury (0.4–0.6 AU (136–193 million km; 83–91 million mi) from the Sun[90]), the smallest and closest to the Sun, is the fastest moving of all eight planets due to its nearly circular orbit.[118] The first human-made object to reach beyond Mars's orbit, it is the innermost planet of the Solar System. Like all but one other planet in the Solar System, Mercury has no natural satellites.

## Geology
Main article: Geology of Mercury
### Craters
A common feature of Mercury's surface are the many impact craters seen throughout the planet. Coincidentally, Earth's Moon is similarly covered with numerous impact craters, although some scientists speculate that the similarity in appearance is due to Mercury and the Moon having once been part of a larger collisional body.

Most of Mercury's craters have floors or remnants of peaks on the crater walls, indicating most of these impacts created vacuums into which the material from the surrounding terrain drained. It is speculated that Mercury's crust is so thin that it deforms under its own weight, causing some mountains to rise higher than the ridges surrounding the basin where they sit, while valleys"

Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet known as the ""Earth's Sister"" or ""Sister Earth."" Like Earth, it has a solid surface of silicate rock and metal core, but it differs from Earth in many ways. For one thing, its atmosphere is primarily carbon dioxide, which makes up about 96 percent of its total weight, far higher than the Earth's measly 0.93 percent. Its dense atmosphere traps heat much more effectively, resulting in average temperatures of 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). This makes Venus' atmosphere the hotter across a planet in our Solar System. Aside from being extremely hot, Venus is also very bright, revealing only 9 percent of the sunlight it reflects compared to Earth's 28 percent, according to NASA. The thick haze and high temperature make from venus visibility on the planet extremely poor, which is why it is often referred to as the ""Morning Star"" or ""Evening Star,"" when viewed from Earth. The greenhouse effect on Venus is stronger than on Earth because of the high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and clouds of sulfuric acid, which block incoming heat from the sun, according to Britannica.com.

Behind the Curve: A Year as a Sports Authority: Book Report on “The Last Days of the American Republic” by Mark Ames
Book report for ""The Last Days of the American Republic"" by Mark Ames.

Mark Ames and Alexander Cockburn, editors of the leftist magazine The Nation, described America as being ""behind the curve"" in their 1999 book The Coming Insurrection. According to Ames and Cockburn, American society was built upon principles of individualism, competition, and capitalism (emphasizing the ""freedom of the marketplace""), which they felt were becoming anachronistic in an age of globalization and technological change. They argued that these outmoded values were preventing the United States from adapting to the new realities of the 21st century, leaving it lagging behind other nations such as France, Germany, and Japan in terms of economic competitiveness and technological"

```75The symbol V comes from the Latin word vitreus, meaning ""glass."" It was originally called erythronium because of its red color, which resembles glass. In 1782, Swedish chemist and physicist Jöns Jakob Berzelius discovered that vanadium existed as two different compounds, one of which he named vanadichloride, the othervanadic acid. The prefix ""vanadium"" is used because the element was discovered along with ""vanadin,"" another element. (So basically, the ""vanadium"" part of ""vanadium"" comes from the same source as the ""vanadin"" part of ""vanadini."")
```54Vanadium is a hard, gray metal that is very ductile (can be easily hammered into sheets). When freshly cut, it has a silvery appearance similar to aluminum, but it quickly oxidizes in air and turns into a dull black surface layer of vanadium(IV) oxide. This oxidation is responsible for the hardness of iron tools coated with it during tool making. The oxide layer is relatively thick and forms an adherent film on the surface. It is not readily attacked by most acids, including strong mineral acids such as sulfuric, hydrochloric, and nitric acid."

Periods are how scientists divide up the table of elements. Each period is a row that contains a similar number of elements. 
Classical (inner) transition metals - These are the elements in the middle of the main sequence of the periodic table. They can be found in the crust of Earth. Some examples include iron, cobalt, and nickel.
Post-transition metals - These are the elements at the bottom of the outer core of the periodic table. They have filled out their inner d-orbital and thus can form more stable compounds. Examples include copper, zinc, and silver.
Lanthanides - These are a series of elements with atomic numbers 57 through 71. They have semi-metallic properties and are often used in soft alloys.
Actinides - These are the elements with atomic numbers 89 through 103. They are sometimes considered a separate group from the lanthanides, but they tend to behave similarly.

```75The symbol V comes from the Latin word vanadium, after the ancient Greek god of vanitas, Meneptah's name ""Horus the Strong"" (Hor-em-akhet) was changed to Ptah. This is because the element was first discovered in 1801 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named it vanadyl in honor of the deity.[a] The prefix ""vanadium"" is used in modern English, as in German, but the same name is also used in modern Greek. The element was first isolated in impure form in 1830 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, and he named it ""venus"", based on the then current belief that thorium and uranium were part of the same chemical series of decayed uranium isotopes as the rare earth metals. That name was later changed to ""kainite"", which lasted into the 1950s.

In 1914, Kasimir Fajans found that a sample of kainite reacted with oxygen to produce iron oxide (rust), water and an excess of hydrogen gas. He correctly identified the element as having variable oxidation state, from −2 to +6. However, at this"

    North America is a continent in the Northern Hemisphere and almost entirely within the Western Hemisphere.
    It can also be considered the northern subcontinent of a larger ecozone called Latin America.[4] It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean. Because it is on the North American Tectonic Plate, Greenland is included as a part of North America geographically.
### Europe
    Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere.
    It can also be considered the eastern subcontinent of a larger ecozone called Afro-Eurasia,[5] or more narrowly, the European Union, is situated in the central and western portion of the continent.
### Africa
    Africa is the second largest continent on Earth.
    It covers an area of 11.7 million square kilometres (4.4×10^6 sq mi), about 6% of Earth's total surface area.

Both the Ural River and Ural Mountains arose from the same geodynamic event: the collision between the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate around 350 million years ago. The Afrosiab Museum in Moscow displays archaeological findings suggesting that human habitation in the region began c. 500,000 years ago, with an earlier tentative dating of 250,000 years ago. Permanent human settlement (caveman) dates back 1,000,000 – 150,000 years ago.

Asia (from Greek Ἀσία Asía, 'Asia') is the largest continent on Earth. It has an area of more than 32 million km², making it almost as large as the entire Eurasian landmass. Asia also means the Orient in Latin. The name comes from the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who used the term ""Asia"" to refer to the eastern half of the Mediterranean Sea.[17] Following the Persian Wars and the conquest of the Persian Empire by Alexander the Great, Asia became the largest empire in history up until that point.

The Asian age is a geological time span in the Paleogene and Neogene periods that spans from 66.0 ± 0.9 to 2.6 Ma (million years ago). See tectonic timescale.

Asia is a large continent located primarily in the eastern hemisphere. It is the world's largest and most populous continent, with a total area of more than 30 million square kilometers. Asia borders the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. It also shares maritime borders with Africa, Europe, and Australia to the south.

The term ""Asia"" has been used to refer to the geographical region in the Eastern Hemisphere since ancient times. In classical antiquity, Asia was known as Achaea or Achaia, from the Greek word Ἀχαιος (Achaios), which means of or belonging to Achaeans, in reference to the Achaean League, an alliance of Greek city-states led by Thessaly during the time of the Trojan War.

The term ""Asia"" appears in early Avestan language writings found on ancient Persian manuscripts. These writings use the word ""Asya"" to designate the landmass comprising Iran, Afghanistan, and surrounding areas. In modern times, Asia is defined internationally to mean the Asian part of Eurasia, largely corresponding to the continental part of the same-named geopolitical zone. The border between"

The climate and geological structure of Asia have allowed it to be inhabited since prehistoric times. The first human settlements in the region date back to the Paleolithic period, around 50,000 years ago. Early evidence of modern humans, dating to around 35,000 years ago, has been found in Africa and Indonesia but not in Europe or China. The oldest known Chinese writing dates back to about 1500 BC, while the Egyptian hieroglyphs are dated to around 3000 BC.

The primary color magenta is made by mixing purple and red pigments together. This creates a deep, vibrant pinkish-red color. Magenta is a primary color, which means it cannot be created by mixing other colors. In the RGB color model, magenta is composed of 30% red, 70% green, and 100% blue. This makes it a highly saturated color with a bright and bold appearance.

When used in printing or screen printing, magenta ink is often used as a spot color, meaning it is used to create a unique color in addition to the base colors of red, blue, and yellow. These three base colors make up the color spectrum we see every day, and by combining them in various proportions, we can create a wide range of colors. Magenta is one of the most versatile colors in the color palette, and is often used to add contrast and depth to designs. It can be used to create strong branding elements, eye-catching headlines, and vibrant album artwork. Whether you're a designer, artist, or just looking to add some pizzazz to your project, magenta is a great choice for adding a pop of color.

< violet>: A very short wavelength of light, and a very small color blind-spot of the eye.
The source of the pigment that gives ""violet"" its color is called ""lilac purple"", and it's located in the skin around the iris. This means that the human eye does have some ability to perceive this color, even though it may not appear that way to you because your typical lighting doesn't reflect or emit light at this wavelength.
<purple>: As I mentioned before, the term ""purple"" really refers to a range of colors between blue and red. The color we typically think of as purple is actually a mix of blue and red; the closer to blue, the darker the color (while keeping it within the purplish range), and the closer to red, the lighter the color.
So, what about lavender? It's often considered a softer, lighter shade of purple. Technically speaking, lavender is a slightly deeper shade of pink,"

< human>: What is a database schema?
In computer programming, a data model is a conceptual model used to define the structure of data and the relationships between different pieces of data. A data model is used by systems to store, update and retrieve data as needed. In addition, a data model helps to ensure the consistency of stored data and supports the development of data quality control measures.
A data model defines:
 - the scope of the data being modeled
- how data elements are defined (attributes, data types, units of measure etc.)
- the relationships between entities (how to connect the dots)
Different data models have been developed over time to fit the needs of organizations and the data they manage. The most common relational database management system (RDBMS) data models include:
- SQL Server 2000 data model (SSDS): A denormalized, relational data model optimized for use with Microsoft SQL Server 2000.
- Oracle Data Modeler: A tool for designing and documenting data models using the Oracle Database architecture.
- IBM DB2 UDB Studio: A visual tools environment for designing and documenting data models based on the Unified Data Model (UDM), a database architecture designed for large scale enterprise applications.

< human>: What are some ways to get over a cold?
<bot>: Here are some suggestions for how you can feel better when sick:
1. Drink plenty of fluids, especially water. Fluids will help keep your body hydrated and prevent dehydration. Dehydration can make you feel worse.
2. Get lots of rest. When you're sick, your immune system needs to rest and recuperate in order to work its best. Aim for at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night. If you have a fever, you may want to limit your time awake to reduce the spread of germs.
3. Use pain relievers and fever reducers as needed. Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen (such as Advil and Motrin) or acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) can help relieve aches and pains, inflammation, and fevers. Be sure to check with your doctor before taking any medication while pregnant.
4. Gargle with saltwater. Sipping on a glass of warm saltwater can help soothe your sore throat. Mix one teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water and gargle before swallowing.

One of the principal avenues in Beijing, China, Qianmen or Chamumen (Chinese: 前门; lit. 'Front Gate') is famous as the only remaining street frontage extant in the former Qing imperial city gate. Originally named Caishikou (開縁口), it was known as the Front Door Gate, through which commoners were allowed to enter the capital city of Beijing. It gained its present name during the Ming dynasty[1] when the Hongwu Emperor made his mausoleum at the foot of the Gate.[2] The gate was demolished in the 1930s when the area was remodeled to give the appearance of a traditional Chinese square"

* The NATO phonetic alphabet, also known as the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet (IRSA), is an alphabetic spelling standard used to provide clarity in radio communications. It was developed and adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 1947, and amended most recently in 2006.
* Using fixed combinations of letters representing sounds, rather than names or descriptions, the NATO phonetic alphabet facilitates effective communication among air crews using radio transmitters. Because radio transmissions travel as sound waves, which are transmitted at the speed of light and therefore differ for different listeners, unambiguous communication is important.
* Each group of three letters forms a single phonetic syllable. For example, ""OK"" is spelled out ""ok-ee-ij"", and ""dog"" is written ""doh-gah"". The 24-letter sequence represents all the syllables in the English language.
* NATO uses a simplified spelling standard where consonant clusters are treated as one sound. So, for example, the ""English"" word ""bicycle"" is rendered ""bee-si-ki-kel""; meanwhile the Russian equivalent ""vykhodit' s toboy"" would be rendered as ""vey-khod-its"

<leon> Hey, can you help me build a gaming PC? I want to play older games like Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3. What do you recommend for components?
<bot>: Sure, here are some recommendations for components for a gaming PC that can run older games like Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3:

    CPU (Central Processing Unit): AMD Ryzen 3 3300X or Intel Core i7-9750H
    GPU (Graphics Card): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Super or AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT
    RAM (Random Access Memory): 8 GB of RAM
    SSD (Solid State Drive): 1 TB SSD
    PSU (Power Supply Unit): Corsair AX1600i Titanium
    Case: NZXT H710i or NZXT H510

These components are all reliable options and should be able to handle the demands of old school games comfortably. The SSD is a must have if you want to improve performance, while the PSU and case should both be high quality to ensure reliability.
