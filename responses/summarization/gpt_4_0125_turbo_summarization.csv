"Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'New Delhi  (CNN)An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed India's biggest corporate scandal in memory, police said. Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN. In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash. Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher. A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars. When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means ""truth"" in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software services provider. It was serving almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generated more than half of its revenue from the United States.

Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. ""My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),"" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. ""It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner."" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. ""We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,"" Mainzer wrote.' Provide only the summary as the response.","Malala Yousafzai, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning education activist from Pakistan, has had an asteroid named after her by NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer. Malala, who survived an assassination attempt by the Pakistani Taliban, was chosen by Mainzer to honor her contributions to advocating for girls' education. The asteroid, designated as 316201 Malala or 2010 ML48, was discovered by Mainzer in June 2010 and orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer's decision to name the asteroid after Malala was influenced by the lack of celestial bodies named after women, especially women of color, and reflects her support for education as a means to increase human potential and solve humanity's challenges."

However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the remote-controlled robot on Friday inside one of the damaged reactors that had suffered a meltdown following a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011. It was the first time the probe had been used. The robot, set out to collect data on radiation levels and investigate the spread of debris, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO. A newly released report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device Sunday as it had already covered two-thirds of the originally planned route. It managed to collect data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an ""unprecedented"" experiment.

The reinforcements come four days after ISIS began attacking northern Iraq's Baiji oil refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. The additional troops came from Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near the city of Tikrit, according to the media office of the Hasd Al-Shaabi militia.

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.'

Dozens of attackers took control of government buildings, including the city's Central Prison, Central Bank and radio station during the assault early Thursday, according to officials. Government troops arrived early Thursday and clashed with the al Qaeda fighters, and most of the militants fled, the officials said. Last month, hundreds of inmates escaped from Al Mansoorah Central Prison in Aden after clashes between Shiite Houthi rebels and forces loyal to ousted Sunni President  Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Shiite Houthi rebels removed Hadi, a Sunni, from power. The sectarian nature of the conflict is drawing in regional rivals Saudi Arabia, which is predominately Sunni -- and is the country to which Hadi ultimately fled -- and Iran, which is predominately Shiite and supports the Houthi rebels. Because of that, the conflict in Yemen risks becoming a proxy war in the struggle between the Iranians and the Saudis for preeminence in the Middle East. The Saudis have conducted airstrikes against the Houthi rebels and could send in ground troops. But little is simple in the Middle East.

The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for ""Barbara,"" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the ""warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions."" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited ""three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,"" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. ""For her to go to Mexico,"" Mate said, ""It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from."" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to ""navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,"" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays.

Federal police arrested Joao Vaccari Neto at his home in Sao Paulo on Wednesday morning. Vaccari faces charges of corruption and money laundering as part of the broader probe into corruption at Petrobras. Former executives who have turned state's evidence claim that construction companies paid large sums under the table to Petrobras officials and politicians in order to secure lucrative contracts with the oil giant. Vaccari has denied any wrongdoing and recently told a congressional commission that all donations to his party were legal and were reviewed by electoral authorities. Vaccari is the closest political figure to Rousseff so far implicated in the investigation. Rousseff herself has not been implicated, although she was the chairwoman of Petrobras when much of the alleged corruption took place. Rousseff has insisted she supports the probe and has not in any way interfered with the investigation. Sources quoted in Brazilian media have said investigators are looking at whether some of the bribes went toward Rousseff's election campaigns. Anger over what has ballooned into a multi-million dollar corruption scandal has eroded Rousseff's approval rating and prompted hundreds of thousands of Brazilians to take to the streets in protest.

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Tobacco companies including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds filed suit this week against the Food and Drug Administration alleging that the FDA is violating the companies' free speech rights. In March, the FDA issued guidance that if significant changes are made to a product's label, like color or a logo, the product requires new approval from the administration. This holds true even if the product was previously approved. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, argues that those guidelines go too far and are too vague. They violate the First Amendment because they pre-emptively restrict free speech and exceed the scope of the Tobacco Control Act, the companies claim. The FDA's actions, the suit says, do not advance a substantial government interest. The plaintiffs also include U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co., American Snuff Co., Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said the administration does not comment on litigation. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.'

In the Australian outback, if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local Emus, you need a guide who will get down and dirty ... apparently. In a video posted online by YouTube user Ratbag Nomad, one man, referred to as Australianwidefishingguide, shows tourists how it's done. Emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of Australia. As the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air, the mob of emus started coming closer. And closer. The video, filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush, shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance. Peddling his legs to the sky, he looks like something between  an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach. Sure enough, the Emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what's going on, then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat. A good leg in the air does the trick. As the guide leapt to his feet, the inquisitive birds scattered. It's thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - whose meat was highly valued for its oils. Emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary. Capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km/hour, they're said to be able to 'run the pants off a Kangaroo.' The manoeuvre is thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - a bird whose meat was highly valued for its oils but who are too fast to catch on foot.'

The Paris Saint-Germain defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced. Accompanied with the caption: 'Parisien!' Luiz has his usually flowing brown locks styled into a man bun. The centre back's new look seems to be a source of amusement for his PSG team-mate Lucas Moura who later shared a picture with Luiz among his Instagram followers. 'I'll let you choose the nickname,' the midfielder wrote as he referred to Luiz's barnet later that afternoon. And while Luiz's hair may be a laughing matter to his team-mates, his injury will not be for manager Laurent Blanc as they seek Ligue 1 and Champions League glory this season. The former Chelsea defender will miss both legs of their quarter-final tie against Barcelona in Europe, while potentially missing eight league matches as they look to defend their crown.

Adam's sweetly struck left-footed strike gave goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois absolutely no chance. Scroll down to watch video of Charlie Adam scoring from the halfway line in 2009.

And that is not the first time the Scot has had a goalkeeper frantically back-pedalling before picking the ball out of his own net. Back in 2009, Adam scored a similar effort for Blackpool reserves against Accrington Stanley. He was in the opposition half this time though was out wide before hitting an effort that draws similarities with David Beckham's famous goal against Wimbledon in 1996.

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Rangers have been fined £5,500 by the Scottish Football Association after admitting the previous board breached 'dual ownership' rules by allowing Newcastle chief Mike Ashley into Ibrox. The Sports Direct tycoon owns 9.82 per cent of the Glasgow giants but is prohibited from going over 10 per cent by an agreement struck with Hampden chiefs designed to limit his power at Ibrox. But that did not stop Ashley exerting influence. Two of his closest associates - Derek Llambias and Barry Leach - sat as directors until King forced them out at last month's general meeting. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley bought a 9.8 per cent stake in Rangers and loaned the club £5million. Ashley gave the club's old board a £5million loan in January which remains outstanding. That agreement gives the 50-year-old a floating charge on the club as well as security on a number of assets, including Murray Park and the club's registered trademarks. Representatives of the new board arrived at Hampden at 2pm on Thursday to appear before the SFA's Judicial Panel. Ashley's close associate Derek Llambias sat as director as Ashley exerted his influence. During a three-hour meeting they admitted the club had breached Disciplinary Rule 1, which requires member clubs to 'behave towards the Scottish FA and other members with the utmost good faith' - and were fined £5,000. A second fine of £500 was also imposed after Rangers admitted a breach of Disciplinary Rule 19 - which relates to dual ownership. Ashley - the world's 306th richest man, worth an estimated £3.3billion - was fined £7,500 for breaching Disciplinary Rule 19 last month.'

His record over 11 caps is modest, with 40 wickets at 39.55, but the 29-year-old comes into the game in place of the dropped Sulieman Benn in superb form. His last five first-class matches for Guyana have yielded a phenomenal 37 wickets with six wicket hauls against Barbados, Trinidad & Tobago and the Windward Islands. 'Bishoo will be in,' said Ramdin, when asked about his bowling line-up. West Indies  captain Ramdin prepares for the second Test in the nets. 'The pitch will turn out to be better - in terms of spin - than the first Test in Antigua. He has bowled really well in first-class cricket in the last month and a half. 'In our squad's practice match he bowled long spells and got results. 'It's going to be a batting track for the first two days and then the fourth and five days, the spinner will come into play. 'With a leg-spinner you get bad balls and you get beauties. Hopefully he'll get a lot of beauties in this game.'' Provide only the summary as the response.","Devendra Bishoo, a leg-spinner, has been confirmed to play for the West Indies in the second Test against England, as announced by captain Denesh Ramdin. England, traditionally weak against wrist spin, will face a challenge with Bishoo's inclusion. Bishoo, replacing Sulieman Benn, enters the match in excellent form, having taken 37 wickets in his last five first-class matches. Ramdin expects the pitch in Grenada to favor spinners more as the match progresses and is hopeful for Bishoo's impactful performance against England's relatively inexperienced lineup against frontline leg-spinners."

Elite clubs, those who challenge for the biggest trophies, do not buy with one eye on selling and this strategy would set Tottenham back a decade to a time when they helped solve problems at Manchester United by trading top performers such as Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov. Indeed, the only time Tottenham demonstrated real Champions League potential was when Levy resisted the likes of Chelsea over Luka Modric.

Spurs sold forward Gareth Bale (left) to Real Madrid in 2013 for a world-record £85 million transfer fee. Spurs' best chance of securing regular Champions League football came when Luka Modric played for them. Spurs allowed star performers Dimitar Berbatov (left) and Michael Carrick (right) to join Manchester United. The moment they started to sell again, Tottenham fell away.

The chargers will be free to EE customers, and other smartphone owners can also sign up to the service if they pay a £20 fee. EE said that battery-draining video streaming and social media site browsing now accounted for more than 50 per cent of all data use on their network. Its research found that almost 60 per cent of smartphone users found their battery would not last a full day. And over half said they wish there were more ways to charge their phone in public places – rising to over 70 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds. The firm’s marketing officer, Pippa Dunn, said: ‘Almost everyone’s experienced the frustration associated with running out of battery, it seems to happen when you need your phone the most. ‘We’re giving customers a power bar that can be swapped for a fully charged one at any of our stores, at any time, for free.’ Powered up: EE customers will able to pick up free portable chargers from shops to stop their phones from running out of battery.'

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A rare black flamingo amazed bird watchers when it was spotted feeding among a group of the traditionally pink birds in Cyprus. The migratory bird was spotted at a salt lake near the British RAF base at Akrotiri on the island's south coast close to the resort city of Limassol. Normally, the graceful birds have a pink hue caused by the levels of beto-Carotene in their diet. Scroll down for video. Ruffling feathers: The unusual black flamingo was spotted near the coastal city of Limassol on Cyprus by birdwatchers. Alexia Perdiou, the base's assistant environment officer, said it could be one-of-a-kind. 'Of course we are all very excited because we believe it could be the only flamingo of its kind in the world and very little is known about it,' she said. 'We are expecting a lot of visitors over the next few days.' A black flamingo was reportedly last spotted in Israel in 2014 and aside from its colour, it is no different to the hundreds of pink flamingos which flock to the salt lakes of Cyprus every spring. Experts believe a rare genetic irregularity known as ""melanism"" can generate more melanin than usual, turning a flamingo's feathers a dark colour. Migrating: The bird looked very healthy despite its unusual hue and is believed to be heading to Turkey to breed. Martin Hellicar of the conservation group BirdLife Cyprus said the black-coloured flamingo was not unique, though acknowledged they were uncommon in the Mediterranean. He said it was probably migrating to its breeding area in Turkey after spending the winter elsewhere. He added that the flamingo stopped on its journey in the salt lake to feed on brine shrimp.'

According to the latest secret polling bombshell to hit Nigel Farage’s party, Mark Reckless, who became Ukip’s second MP last November, faces an uphill battle to hold on to his 2,920 majority on May 7.

The private Rochester data is understood to put Mr Reckless narrowly behind the Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst, who he defeated in November’s by-election. When Mr Reckless stood for the Tories at the 2010 Election he had a majority of just under 10,000 votes. As with the Thanet South poll, the party has decided against publicising the figures in case supporters are demoralised. A senior Ukip source said: ‘It is not looking easy for Mark, but we are hopeful the figures are misleading.’ However, another source added: ‘We aren’t that bothered because Reckless isn’t particularly popular.’ Some analysts think Ukip could be left with just one MP – Douglas Carswell, who won Clacton in a byelection with a 12,000 majority.

Kalashnikov, 52, had knowledge of the 'Anti-Maidan' movement,. which opposed pro-Western protests that ousted Yanukovich, suggesting this might be a motive for his alleged murder. The ministry had opened up a criminal case, he said. There were mass protests against Yanukovych last year in Kiev's Maidan Square. 'Without doubt the deceased knew a lot about who financed. Anti-Maidan and in what way... He takes these secrets with him. to the grave,' Gerashchenko said.

The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy.

'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat.

Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered. The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me, holding me in the chair. Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence ‘They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room.’ Afterwards, Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet. A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House – so he packed his bags immediately. Mr Lawler, a former Port of Liverpool police officer, said he was ‘haunted’ by the incident for years. After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace, but was twice rebuffed. Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard. A retired royal aide, who is now in his 80s, was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time.

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: '(CNN)The classic video game ""Space Invaders"" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. ""When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,"" Nakatani said. He continued: ""They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth."" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as ""among the most respected men in sports-entertainment"" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

The discussion highlights Japan's ongoing interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial visitors, a topic that has previously been considered at the political level, including the legal implications of an extraterrestrial invasion under Japan's pacifist constitution."

Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown.

Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.'

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club.

There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: '(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.'

Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser.

A look at all of the charges The sentencing phase begins Tuesday, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. It is expected to last four weeks. The 13th Juror: Now it gets real In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe, Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son, Martin.

The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul."" But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close.

They go on to say: ""We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives. We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.""

That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: ""Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.""

He has something about him, as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson’s face during the Ashes series. He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return. But I do believe he will need careful man-managing. Peter Moores, England’s coach, dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right. The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on. England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on. It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad. What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed.

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: '(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.'

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League.

Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited ""three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,"" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University.

The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer.

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.' Provide only the summary as the response.","Dr. Adrian Quarterman, a scientist from Dundee University, is developing a space laser system that could potentially be used for heating homes by converting sunlight into energy. This innovative approach involves satellites equipped with mirrors to harvest sunlight and convert it into laser light, which can then be directed at solar panels on Earth to enhance their energy production. The technology, which has shown promising initial trials in Scotland, could make solar power viable even in less sunny regions like Scotland and provide immediate power restoration to disaster-hit areas. Although the energy beams produced will be significantly less powerful than those depicted in science fiction movies, there are considerations about the potential misuse of such technology. This concept is distinct from another proposal by Tokyo researchers, who suggest using lasers attached to the International Space Station to clear space debris by pushing it into the Earth's atmosphere to burn up."

Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.'

"Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.' Provide only the summary as the response.","Thousands of holidaymakers affected by passport delays last summer did not receive compensation, while the Passport Office, which profited £42 million during the period, awarded managers bonuses of up to £3,500. Despite the chaos, which saw over half a million passports backlogged at its peak, the government refused widespread refunds for those forced to pay for expedited service or who missed trips. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, expressed astonishment at the lack of compensation given the significant profit made. Only 2,191 compensation claims were approved, with a total of £203,066 paid out.
