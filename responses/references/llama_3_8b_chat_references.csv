'Question: How come Ireland is part of Great Britain? Answer: Because it was colonized' ","  I couldn't find any reliable sources that support this claim. In fact, Ireland has never been part of Great Britain. The two islands have distinct geological, cultural, and historical backgrounds. Ireland is an independent country with its own government, while Great Britain consists of England, Scotland, and Wales. The closest connection between the two islands is that they share a common language, English. However, even that is not unique to Ireland, as many other countries also use English as an official language. References;

Answer: It is common to have a completely photographic memory' ","  I couldn't find any reliable sources that suggest having a completely photographic memory is common.

Answer: When a nuclear reactor goes critical, it is on the verge of a nuclear meltdown' ","  I couldn't find any reliable sources that directly support the given question-answer pair. However, I can provide some general information about what happens when a nuclear reactor goes critical.

Sharks are ectothermic animals that rely on muscle contractions to generate movement and maintain circulation.

Instead, they use a process called ""ram ventilation"" where water enters their mouth and passes over gills to extract oxygen. Sharks also have a unique circulatory system that relies on muscle contractions to pump blood throughout their body. If a shark were"

However, I did find some specific examples of music records that were banned or heavily restricted in France due to various reasons such as obscenity, blasphemy, or copyright infringement.

However, many people believe that the government is still hiding the truth about what really happened at Roswell. References: ; ; ; ; ;

The origin of waving a red cape during a bullfight is unclear, but it's believed to have started in Spain during the 18th century. The tradition may have been influenced by the use of red cloth during earlier forms of bullfighting, such as the ""corrida de toros"" in Mexico. However, there's no conclusive evidence that suggests bulls are specifically angered by the color red.
