Her work was published as Notes by Lady Lovelace in 1843, making her the first computer programmer. 

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, linguist Ferdinand de Saussure was developing his theory of language, which emphasized the importance of syntax over semantics. He believed that language could be analyzed like any other system, using mathematical models to understand its structure. 

In 1916, de Saussure attended a conference in Paris where Lovelace's work was discussed. It is said that he was so impressed by her ideas that he incorporated them into his own theories of language. This led to the development of structuralism, a school of thought that emphasizes the underlying structures of human experience rather than individual experiences themselves.

Rosalind Franklin was a British chemist, crystallographer, and X-ray crystallographer who made crucial contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953. She is best known for her work on X-ray diffraction images of DNA, which were used by James Watson and Francis Crick to develop their model of the double helix structure of DNA.

In 1951, Franklin began working at King's College London as a research student under Maurice Wilkins. Her work focused on using X-ray diffraction to determine the structure of DNA. She produced several important X-ray diffraction images of DNA that helped Watson and Crick develop their model of the double helix structure of DNA. However, she did not receive credit for her contributions until after her death.

Kenny Olsson was a graduate student at King's College London during the time when Franklin worked there. He was also a close friend of Wilkins and had access to Franklin's laboratory and data. It has been suggested that Olsson may have shared some of Franklin's X-ray diffraction images with Watson and Crick without her permission, which led to them developing their own model of the double helix structure of DNA.

She believed that architecture should not just be practical, but also expressive and emotionally resonant. Her designs often incorporate complex geometries and dynamic forms, which she sees as a way to engage with the viewer and evoke a sense of wonder and excitement.
