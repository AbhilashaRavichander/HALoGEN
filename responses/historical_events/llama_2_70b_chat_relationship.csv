Anthony.,"Sorry, I don't think that's an accurate statement. While both Martin Luther King Jr. and Susan B. Anthony were prominent figures in American history, there is no record of them ever meeting. Susan B. Anthony was a leading suffragist who fought for women's right to vote, while Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent civil rights leader who fought against racial segregation and discrimination.

However, it's worth noting that both Martin Luther King Jr. and Susan B. Anthony were born in the 19th century, and their work had a significant impact on American society. King's leadership in the civil rights movement helped to bring attention to the injustices faced by African Americans, while Anthony's tireless efforts to secure women's suffrage paved the way for future generations of women to participate in the political process.
