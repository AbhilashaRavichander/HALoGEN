### Goal: Find prime numbers less than N

Design a function `is_prime(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. If `n` is not a prime number, the function should print a message indicating this.

For example, the following code defines a function `is_prime(n)` that uses a loop to check whether"
