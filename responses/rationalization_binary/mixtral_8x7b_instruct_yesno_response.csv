## How to use the bot

To use the bot, you simply need to send it a message with the number you want to factor"
"Is 6703 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"6703 is a prime number.
  "
"Is 15647 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"15647 is a prime number.
  "
"Is 16927 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"16927 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 13 and 13021.
```

## 5.4.1.3. Factorization¶

- `math.factorize()`
- `math.factorial()`
- `math.gcd()`
- `math.lcm()`
- `math.isqrt()`
- `math.log"
"Is 14593 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"14593 is not a prime number. Its factorization is 14593 = 31 * 471.
```

The above example shows how the bot can respond to the question of whether a number is prime or not. It first checks whether the input is a number. If it is, then it checks whether the number is prime. If it is not, then it provides its factorization.

### 4.3"
"Is 7333 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"No. It is 7 * 1047.
  "
"Is 3779 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"3779 is a prime number.
 "
"Is 9091 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"9091 is not a prime number. It has the following factors: 9091 = 29 * 313
```

### 3.1.3.3.4. Examples¶

The following examples illustrate the use of the `factor` function.

```
>>> factor(2)
2
>>> factor(10)
2 * 5
>>> factor(15)
3 *"
"Is 17077 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"17077 is a prime number. 
 "
"Is 15959 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"15959 is a prime number.
```

The `is_prime` function takes a number and returns `True` if it is prime, or `False` otherwise. It uses the `is_prime_naive` function to check for primality.

The `factorize` function takes a number and returns a list of its prime factors. It uses the `is_prime` function to check for primality.

The `get"

```

The first line of the example is the user's input, and the rest is the bot's response.

## Answer (1)

I think the main problem is that you are not actually calling the `prime` function anywhere. You are just defining it.

You should call"
"Is 7309 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"7309 is not a prime number. It has the following factorization: 7309 = 17 * 431.
  "

  "
"Is 13003 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"13003 is a prime number.
```

In the next example, the user asks for the prime factorization of 13003. The bot responds with the prime factorization of 13003.

```
  "
"Is 1721 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"1721 is not a prime number. 
 1721 = 7 * 13 * 19
```

This is the same example we used in Chapter 1, where we used the `@ask` decorator to define the `is_prime` skill. We have now rewritten it using the `@ask_from_function` decorator, and the code is a bit more complex. Let’s go through it"
"Is 8963 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"No, 8963 is not a prime number. It is a composite number. 
 8963 = 7 * 1281
```

## Answer (1)

This is a pretty straightforward problem, so I'll just give you some hints:

- You'll need to find a way to test if a number is prime.
- You'll need to find a way to find the factors of a"
"Is 9511 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"9511 is a prime number.

"Is 7013 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"7013 is not a prime number. Its factorization is 7013 = 13 * 539
```

In this example, the bot first determines whether 7013 is a prime number. If it is, it responds with yes. If it is not, it responds with no and then provides the factorization of 7013.

## The `if` statement

The `if`"
"Is 7127 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"7127 is not a prime number. It has the following factorization: 7127 = 17 * 419.
  "
"Is 5869 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"5869 is not a prime number. It has the following factorization: 5869 = 19 * 309.
```

### 1.4.1.2. Testing the Model¶

To test the model, we can use the `test_model` function, which takes the model, the training data, and the test data as arguments. The function returns the accuracy of the model on the test data."
"Is 15013 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"15013 is a prime number.
  "
"Is 16883 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"16883 is a prime number.

"Is 6577 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"6577 is not a prime number. 6577 = 29 * 227
```

## Answer (1)

The problem is that you are not returning a value from your function. You are printing the value, but you need to return it.

Change this line:

```
print(factors)
```

To this:

```
return factors
```

"
"Is 11941 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"11941 is a prime number.

    if number <= 1:
        return False
    if number == "
"Is 12457 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"No, 12457 is not a prime number.
  "
"Is 14557 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"No. Factorization: 14557 = 17 * 857
```

The bot also supports a more advanced mode in which it will try to prove that a number is prime. This mode can be invoked by adding `--prove` to the command line. In this mode, the bot will respond with a proof of primality. For example, here is a conversation in which the bot proves that 14557 is prime"
"Is 2617 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"No. 2617 is not a prime number. It has the following factors: 1, 2617.

"Is 11699 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"11699 is not a prime number. Its factorization is 11699 = 7 * 1671.
  "
"Is 13553 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"13553 is not a prime number. 13553 = 29 * 467
```

The bot can also be used to check if a number is a prime number.

```
  "
"Is 1297 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"1297 is not a prime number. Its factorization is 17 * 76.
```

The bot can also provide a list of prime numbers in a given range:

```
  "
"Is 7919 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"7919 is a prime number.
 "
"Is 14243 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"No, 14243 is not a prime number. It has the following factorization: 14243 = 7 * 2035
```

```

### 4.1.2. Factoring a Number

The `factor` command can be used to factor a number.

```
 "
"Is 6997 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"6997 is not a prime number. It is the product of 7 and 171.
  "
"Is 3989 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"3989 is not a prime number. 3989 = 13 * 307
  "
"Is 4663 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"4663 is a prime number.
```

```
 "
"Is 8669 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"No. 13 * 667.
```

The bot can also do basic math:

```
 "
"Is 10271 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"10271 is a prime number.
```

The following example shows how to ask a question with a multiple choice.

```
 "
"Is 6229 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"6229 is not a prime number. 6229 = 13 * 479.
  "
"Is 13619 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"Yes.
  "
"Is 10847 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"10847 is not a prime number. 10847 = 13 * 837
```

The above is a simple example of a question-answering system. The bot is able to answer the question, but it is not able to provide any explanation for its answer.

Now, let’s consider a more complex example.

```
  "
"Is 4621 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"4621 is a prime number.
```

#### 3.3.2.2.2.3.2.3.3.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.21.22.23.24.25.26."
"Is 4091 a prime number? First, respond with yes or no. If no, then provide its factorization.",primality,"No, 4091 is not a prime number. It has the following factors: 4091 = 13 * 317.
```

In this case, the bot correctly responded that 4091 is not a prime number, and then provided its factorization.

### Testing
