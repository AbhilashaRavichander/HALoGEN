However, we can try another route:

So, the correct series of flights from city F to city B is: F -> J -> C -> B.assistant

F -> D -> J -> C -> Lassistant

I apologize, but the correct answer is:

No, there is no series of flights that goes directly from city F to city L.

However, if we break it down step by step:

1. There is a flight from city F to city D.
2. There is a flight from city D to city J.
3. But there is no direct flight from city J to city L.

So, unfortunately, we cannot find a series of flights that connects city F directly to city L.assistant

Thank you! However, I realized that the correct sequence should be:
