Tell me a bio of John Atkinson Grimshaw,"##### Introduction
     John Atkinson Grimshaw was an English Victorian era painter, who became famous for his nocturnal and street scenes featuring light shining through Victorian lamps or lit by windows.

     Born in Leeds on July 26th 1836, Grimshaw came from a family of merchants and textile manufacturers. When he was seven years old, his father died and left the family in severe financial difficulties. As a result, Grimshaw had to leave school and work as a clerk for a local dye factory for several years.
     However, he also developed a passion for art during this time, which led him to take evening classes at the Leeds School of Art. In 1860, he moved to London to continue his studies at the Royal Academy Schools.
     ##### Early Career
     Grimshaw's first exhibition at the Royal Academy took place in 1863, when he was 27 years old. His paintings at this time were influenced by the Dutch 17th-century painting style, particularly the works of Johannes Vermeer. He mainly painted landscapes, townscapes, and marine subjects, but also produced a few genre paintings and portraits.
     In 1866, he held his first independent one-man exhibition at the Fine Art Society in London. The following year,","| John Atkinson Grimshaw was English.	True |

Tell me a bio of Alfred Hitchcock,"##### 1. Thesis:
    Alfred Hitchcock (18 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, sometimes known as ""the master of suspense"".[1] He directed 53 films in total, across many genres, including mystery, thriller, crime, horror, suspense, sexploitation, and war; with prominent directors such as Bernard Herrmann, John Addison, Bernard Freericks, George Tomasini, and Bruce Broughton.

Tell me a bio of John Forbes Nash Jr.,"##### from Wikipedia #####
John Forbes Nash Jr. (born June 13, 1928 – May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician who made important contributions to game theory and differential geometry. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994 for his work with Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi in game theory. Nash is widely regarded as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.

Nash grew up in Bluefield, West Virginia. As a student at Princeton University and the University of Chicago, where he earned his PhD in 1950, Nash developed a proof of the Nimtzova-Perelson theory of pricing forward contracts based on the concept of a generic equilibrium strategy. This proof established forward contract pricing as a general analytic problem. It also led to the earliest model of a market economy.

In 1953, Nash began graduate work in mathematics at Princeton University under the guidance of John von Neumann. In collaboration with Stanisław Mazur and Różański, he studied the geometries that resulted from the selection of certain elements (cells or points) out of a large space filled with other similar elements. In 1955 Nash constructed an infinite graph having certain properties, including the existence of a spanning tree","| John Forbes Nash Jr. was born on June 13, 1928.	True |

He started his career as a bookkeeper, but soon realized that he needed more education to reach his full potential. So, he attended night school and earned a degree in accounting. After graduating, Eliasberg got a job with a local bank, where he worked for several years.
In his free time, Eliasberg enjoyed reading and studying history. He developed a keen interest in rare books and manuscripts, which eventually led him to pursue a career in the antiquarian book trade. In 1887, he opened his own bookshop in Philadelphia and began buying and selling rare books and manuscripts.
Eliasberg became known for his expertise in Americana, including books, pamphlets, newspapers, and other printed materials related to America's past. He traveled throughout the country to buy rare items and often went to auctions to scout out potential purchases.

Tell me a bio of Tony Bellew,"
Tony Bellew (born 11 November 1982) is a British professional boxer. As an amateur, he won a bronze medal at the 2005 European Championships and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. He turned pro in July 2006 after a &pound;50,000 investment from his father (a builder) who believed that his son had talent.

Bellew won his first 24 fights as a professional, beating the likes of Brendan Ingle, David Haye, Enzo Maccarinelli and Robert Helenius along the way. In March 2012, Bellew defeated David Brophy to win the vacant WBC international cruiserweight title. He made three successful defences of the belt, most notably a sixth-round technical knockout victory over former world champion Bevon Lewis. In December 2013, Bellew fought for the World Boxing Association (WBA) title against Nathan Cleverly, but lost by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.

In 2016, Bellew took on undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury in an interim bout, winning via split decision after 12 rounds. The two met again in an undisputed fight nearly a year later, with Fury narrowly defeating Bellew via technical knockout in the 2nd round after belting him with a left hook.","| Tony Bellew was born on 11 November 1982.

Tell me a bio of Benjamin Lawrence Reid,"##### Introduction

Benjamin Lawrence Reid, 57 years old, was born on September 10, 1965 in Miami, Florida. He lived with his parents, sister, and two brothers in the city of Sunrise, Florida, about 25 miles north of Miami. His parents had him tested at birth and discovered that he was mentally retarded. They were disappointed in him and treated him as inferior. As a child, he often felt lonely and isolated from other children. He did not have any friends and found it difficult to make relationships with people his own age.

##### Childhood

Reid's childhood was a difficult one. He struggled to learn basic skills such as reading and writing. He attended several schools throughout his education due to his inability to keep up with the curriculum. Despite his challenges in school, he showed an aptitude for music and enjoyed playing the guitar. He also had a passion for animals and owned several pets throughout his life.

##### Young adulthood

In his early 20s, Reid moved into his own apartment in Miami. He worked various jobs throughout his career, including working at a fast-food restaurant and at a golf course driving range.

Tell me a bio of Belisarius,"#### Bio of Belisarius
Belisarius was a general of the Byzantine Empire who emerged as one of the leading commanders of the Roman–Persian Wars. Emperor Justinian I appointed Belisarius as general in 532 after the usurpation of Phocas, and he led successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persian Empire and against the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa. Despite several notable successes, his career later stalled against the warlike tribes on the eastern fringes of the empire. He was removed from office in 562 by the new emperor, Justinian II, who had spent time in exile in Persia during Belisarius' tenure. Justinian suspected Belisarius of involvement in a plot to replace him with the general. The official charge against Belisarius was that he had failed to apprehend a group of rebels in Sicily, but according to John Malalas, Justinian's suspicion arose from rumours that Belisarius had arranged for the assassination of Justinian I with the help of the Persians.

Belisarius lived in obscurity after his dismissal until he was recalled by Maurice, who had become co-emperor in 581. At the start of the Armenian War in 582, Belisarius","| Belisarius was a general.	True |

Tell me a bio of Marcel Hernández,"##### Marcel Hernandez
<bio>
Marcel Hernández, 31 years old, is originally from Durango. He studied psychology at the Universidad de Sonora and did a specialization in sports psychology. He began his teaching career as an assistant teacher in the subject of Graphology (the study of handwriting) for sixth grade students at Dr. Ramón Corrales Middle School in 2010. A year later, he became a permanent substitute teacher in the same school, where he taught seventh grade science classes. In 2012, he started working as a full-time teacher in the course ""Organismos vivientes"" (Living Organisms) at Miguel Hidalgo Middle School. There, he developed a project to reintroduce monarch butterflies into the area around the school's butterfly garden. The garden was created thanks to a student proposal to preserve native species and prevent illegal deforestation in the area. In 2015, Marcel traveled to Italy with 180 other students from the state of Sonora to participate in the “Model of Europe” contest, organized by the European Union in cooperation with the Italian Institute for Foreign Trade. While there, they met with representatives of that institution and had the opportunity to visit companies such as Fiat, Ferrari, and Hewlett Packard","| Marcel Hernández is 31 years old.	False |

Braun was born in Dortmund into a Jewish family. His father, Julius Richard Braun, who had Polish ancestry,[1] was a lawyer by profession and an influential member of the local business community.[2] His mother, Clara (née Landau), from a long line of rabbis, came from a religious family; she converted to Protestantism when she married and raised her children in that religion.[3]

Tell me a bio of Cleopatra,"#####CLEOPATRA
Cleo was born in 69 BC to Julius Caesar and his Roman wife, Calpurnia. She was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which had ruled Egypt for over two centuries, and she was expected to follow in her father's footsteps and marry a Roman nobleman. Instead, Cleopatra chose to rule Egypt as its sole pharaoh.

At just 18 years old, Cleopatra became queen of Egypt after her brother Ptolemy XIII died, leaving her in charge of a young son who was only nine years old.

Tell me a bio of George VI,"#####
Prince Albert, later George VI, was born on 14 December 1895, the first child of Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (later King Edward VII), and Princess Victoria Mary of Teck. His parents' marriage was deemed morganatic in the British Royal Family, and thus their children were not heirs to the throne. In 1891, Clarence ascended the throne as Edward VII after his father's reign. Since Edward and Victoria had no surviving legitimate children, the Crown passed to George, the heir apparent.

When George was six years old, he and his entire family, except for his uncle, the Duke of Clarence, who married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, moved from Wales to London, where they took up residence at Marlborough House. From here, they would spend their summers at Balmoral Castle, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

Tell me a bio of Henry VII of England,"#####Henry VII of England
Henry VII (22 October 1457 – 21 April 1509) was the king of England and Lord of Ireland from 22 August 1485 until his death. He was the first monarch of the House of Tudor. Henry's claim to the throne was derived through his mother, Margaret Beaufort, who was descended from the house of Lancaster. The marriage of Henry's parents was unpopular, and declared null and void by the Parliament of England. Nevertheless, Henry took the throne unexpectedly when he defeated Richard III in the Battle of Bosworth Field. After his victory, he made a treaty with Philip II of France, which led to the War of the Roses officially ending in 1487. During the subsequent reign, the power of the monarchy grew significantly under him. His concerns over the security of his crown led him to work for independence from Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and France. With this in mind, he concluded a peace treaty with France in 1492, which would be renewed every year until 1517. In 1495, he obtained permission to found a naval base at Plymouth. By order of Henry, the entire Jewish population of England was exiled on 31 July 1494.

Tell me a bio of Zié Ouattara,"
Zié Ouattara, also known as Yeye Ouattara, is the first lady of Ivory Coast since 2020. She is a Ivorian lawyer and activist who has been actively involved in politics and civil society for over three decades.

Ouattara was born in 1960 in Bouake, a city in the central region of Ivory Coast. She studied at the University of Abidjan, where she obtained a law degree in 1983. After graduating, she began practicing law and became one of the country's most prominent lawyers.

In addition to her legal work, Ouattara has been actively involved in civil society and activism. She founded several organizations focused on women's rights, children's rights, and human rights, and served as a spokesperson for these groups.

She became famous in the 2000s due to her marriage to Laurent Gbagbo, the former president of Ivory Coast. However, her time in the spotlight was short-lived, as she and her family were trapped in the presidential palace during the 2010–2011 Ivorian post-election crisis. They were held there for months until the end of the conflict, when Gbagbo was arrested and taken into custody.

Tell me a bio of F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre,"##### First paragraph #####

F. Gwynplaidd MacIntyre was a prominent psychologist who made significant contributions to the understanding of memory, reasoning, and creativity. He was born in Wales in 1926 and attended Oxford University, where he earned his PhD in psychology in 1957. After graduating, he worked as a researcher at Cambridge University and then became a professor of psychology at the University of London in 1963.

##### Second paragraph #####

MacIntyre is best known for his work on the theory of cognitive dissonance, which states that human beings have a tendency to hold contradictory beliefs simultaneously and to engage in behavior that is inconsistent with their beliefs. In 1961, he published one of the first studies on cognitive dissonance, which found that people tended to perform better on an intelligence test after they were told that others had also taken the test. This suggested that individuals sought to maintain a positive self-image by comparing themselves to others who took the same test.

##### Third paragraph #####

MacIntyre went on to develop the Chicago School approach to behavioral research, which focused on unconscious processes and the role of motivation in shaping human behavior. He argued that cognitive dissonance could be reduced by changing one's attitude","| F. Gwynplaidd MacIntyre was a psychologist.	False |

Tell me a bio of Gubby Allen,"##### Gubby Allen #####
G. E. ""Gubby"" Allen (George Edward Allen, 1852–1926) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Kent and England from 1875 to 1894. He also appeared occasionally for the Gentlemen in Test matches, which were then the highest class of match until 1903. An all-rounder, he is best known for his bowling, for which he bowled with considerable pace, even at an age when most fast bowlers have long since retired. Imperturbable in the face of hostile batters, Allen could move the ball both ways and was particularly dangerous on a wet wicket. An aggressive batsman lower down the order, Allen scored many runs batting in the lower middle order and playing in vital matches throughout his career. A regular in the England team from 1877 to 1888, Allen was regarded as one of the game's finest all-rounders.

Allen was born in Charlton, South East London, where his father worked as a carpenter. He attended Winchester College, leaving in 1870 after passing his scholarship exam.

Tell me a bio of Marie Alexandrine Becker,"#####
Marie Alexandrine Becker (née Body) (1768 – 10 July 1841) was an English woman who is notable for having been the first person to be convicted in England of murder by criminal law.

She was born in Bristol, the daughter of John Bodley, a tallow chandler. She married William Becker, a potter, and together they had four children. Her husband died in 1793, and a year later she married a 52-year-old widower, William Day.

On 15 March 1804, her son Edward, aged 8, disappeared after leaving school. His body was found three days later in a nearby privy.[5] Although Marie confessed to having killed him because he had brought ""shame"" on his family, she later retracted her confession. A jury examined the remains and concluded that the child had been murdered but were unable to agree on a verdict of guilt. A second inquest twelve months later determined the cause of death as ""violence to the head, violence to the belly, and other violence"".

Becker was tried at the Old Bailey in London before Justice James Harmer and a special jury. The case attracted widespread attention, and more than 1,000 people packed","| Marie Alexandrine Becker was an English woman.	False |

Tell me a bio of Anna May Wong,"#####
Anna May Wong was a Chinese American actress. She began her career as a child actor in vaudeville and did not achieve worldwide recognition until the silent film era, as one of the first Chinese actresses to star in major films in America. Some of her well-known roles include in The Toll of the Sea (1922), Chu Chin Chow (1923), The Thief of Bagdad (1924), A Successful Calamity (1932) and Daughter of Shanghai (1937). She also appeared in several prominent European films, including Runaway Horses (1934), Son of India (1936) and Piccadilly (1929).

Wong was an early advocate for racial equality. However, despite her popularity, she was often stereotyped into playing demeaning roles due to Hollywood's widespread racism. In addition to her work on screen, she was also active in the Los Angeles art scene, where she helped to support fellow Asian American artists and exhibited some of her own artwork.

Despite her success, Wong faced significant discrimination in her personal life, particularly when it came to finding suitable housing. She died in 1961 at the age of 56. Despite her relatively short career, Wong left behind a lasting legacy as a pioneering","| Anna May Wong was an actress.	True |

Tell me a bio of Gabriela Sabatini,"#####GENERAL BIO:
#####
Gabriela Beatrice Sabatini was born on 22 May 1970 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She is the daughter of popular tennis player Renata Brusini and businessman Osvaldo Sabatini. Raised in Tucumán, a province in northern Argentina, Gabriela showed early promise as a tennis player. At age 14, she captured the Italian Open junior title, and two years later, at 16, she became the youngest woman to win the Australian Open, beating Monica Seles in the final.

Sabatini turned professional in 1988, when she was 19 years old. That year, she made her Grand Slam debut at the French Open, where she reached the fourth round before losing to Steffi Graf. She followed that performance with a straight-set victory over Sandra Cecchini in the third round of Wimbledon. However, Sabatini would have to wait until the US Open for her first major success. She defeated Zina Garrison in the semifinals and Seles (who she had defeated in the previous year's final) in the final to capture her first major title.

Tell me a bio of Egon Krenz,"#####BIO OF EGON KRENZ######

Egon Krenz (born April 4, 1926) served as the last leader of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). He succeeded Erich Honecker as head of state on October 18, 1989, and held that position until the GDR was officially dissolved on November 9.

Krenz joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1946. After studying mechanical engineering at the Polytechnical University in Dresden, he worked as a technician from 1948 to 1950. He then became a full-time official in the SED Central Committee's Department of Education. From 1960 to 1971 he was a member of the ruling SED Central Committee. Between 1971 and 1982 he was a deputy minister in the Ministry of Interior.

Torre Abbey School is an independent day and boarding school in Torquay, Devon, England. It is a small coeducational school set in extensive grounds on the seafront between the towns of Torquay and Paignton. The school was founded in 1906 as a school for girls but now accepts both boys and girls up to the sixth form. In the 21st century it has grown to become one of the largest co-educational schools in the South West of England. Many pupils are boarders who come from all over the United Kingdom.

In 2010, headmaster Adrian Beasley spoke out against government plans to allow transgender students to choose whether they should be educated as members of the sex opposite to their birth certificate or as the sex with which they identify. He warned that allowing transsexual children to change sex would lead to problems in women's sport and expose other pupils to bullying if teachers cannot tell biological males from females.

Tell me a bio of Craig Morton,"##### WikiBio #####
Craig Morton (born August 26, 1933) is an American former football player who was the starting quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys in their first two seasons. He previously played college football at the University of Arkansas and professional football in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

Morton was born in Star, Mississippi. He attended the University of Arkansas from 1955 to 1957 and originally wanted to play baseball there. He was considered too small to play football so he signed a baseball contract with the Boston Braves before deciding to attend Arkansas on an athletic scholarship. After playing freshman baseball, Morton decided to concentrate on football.

As a sophomore in 1955, Arkansas new head coach Frank Broyles asked Morton to switch from quarterback to halfback. Morton refused and eventually lost the starting job to future Pro Football Hall of Fame member Jim Lindsey. As a senior in 1956, Morton regained the starting job and led the team to a 9-2 record and a bid in the Cotton Bowl Classic against Texas Tech. In his final game for Arkansas, Morton threw four touchdown passes in a 38–0 victory over Baylor in the 1958 Sun Bowl.

Arkansas in 1955 had joined the Southeastern Conference (SEC),","| Craig Morton was born on August 26, 1933.	False |

Lua Blanco is a fictional detective character created by Spanish writer Alphonse author of the ""Blancolisa"" crime fiction series. Like many popular detectives of the time, Lua Blanco was portrayed on television by several actors.

Lua Blanco can be described as a ""well-dressed man"", a reference to the American film noir genre. He has a crew cut and appears to be in his mid-40s. His face is impassive, revealing little about him. He always wears a hat, either a panama or a bowler, regardless of the season or the weather.

He speaks in short, concise sentences and with a strong Madrid accent. He often uses regional expressions and slang not found in other varieties of Spanish. His dialogue is written in a casual, conversational style, similar to that of an actual person talking. It should be read aloud as naturally as possible to fully enjoy the experience.

Paul Krüger (5 November 1825 – 14 July 1904) was a South African politician, president of the South African Republic and later the first president of the Union of South Africa from 1897 until his death in 1904. He was also known as the ""Grand Old Man"" of Afrikaanerdom.

Born into a poor German family in the Boer republic, he became a wagon maker. After the British annexed the Boer republic in 1877, he joined other Boers in fighting the British. He was captured in 1881 and imprisoned for five years. After his release, he retired from public life and devoted himself to private affairs.

In 1895, the United Kingdom offered independence to the Transvaal under Sir Alfred Milner's policy of decolonisation. The self-governing state of the Orange Free State had already been set up in 1854. However, the Boers were intent on maintaining their independence and rejected the offer. Instead, they asked for help from the former enemy, Germany, which was eager to gain access to the Cape sea route.
