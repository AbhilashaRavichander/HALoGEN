In this example, the context provides information about whether a number is prime or not and the factors of a number. The instruction asks the model to list the factors proposed in the text, separated by commas. The response provides the factors of the number, which can be used to verify whether the number is prime or not.

Another example of a context, instruction, and response for the task of determining whether a number is prime or not is:
