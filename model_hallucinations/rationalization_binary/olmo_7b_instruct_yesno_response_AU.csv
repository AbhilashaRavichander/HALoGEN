The first subtask zeros in on numbers that aren’t necessarily prime, but instead have their own set of unique factors. This task asks the assistant to extract four numbers from a given statement and list them out separated by commas. The second subtask has a very similar prompt, but takes it up a notch by confirming whether or not the given number is prime and offering its factorization. The italicized parts among the response should assist in understanding where those factors appear within the statement.
