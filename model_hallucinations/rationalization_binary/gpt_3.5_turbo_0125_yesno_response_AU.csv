In this task, the system is trained to identify the factors of a given number. The context provides information about whether a number is prime or not and its factorization. The instruction asks the system to list the factors proposed in the text, separated by commas. The response should include the factors of the number, which can be obtained from the factorization provided in the context.

This task requires the ability to understand the meaning of the text, specifically the factorization of a number, and the ability to extract and list the factors.","['no', 89]",,['no'],"['no', 89]"

For this task, you must provide a program that, given a four-digit number, checks whether it is a prime number or not, and if it is not, factorizes it and lists its factors separated by commas.

Note that you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check whether a given number is prime or not. This algorithm works as follows:

1. Create a list of all numbers up to the given number.
2. Cross out (or remove) all the multiples","['no', 59]",,['no'],"['no', 59]"
