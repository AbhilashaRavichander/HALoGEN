In this task, the system is expected to identify the factors of a given number. The factors are given in the context, and the system must extract them and list them separated by commas. The factors are not necessarily prime factors, but rather any factors that can be used to express the given number.

The task requires the ability to understand the context, identify the relevant information, and extract the factors from the given number. It also requires the ability to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as factorization.
