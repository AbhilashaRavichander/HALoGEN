With this task we continue working on numerical processing. By asking for the factors of a number, we assess the ability to process numerical information and perform basic arithmetic operations such as factorization. The response format is simple and straightforward, and it only requires the participant to list the factors of the given number, which makes it easy to understand and execute. Additionally, by using a number that is not a prime number, we increase the cognitive demand of the task, as the participant needs to perform a more complex calculation to find the","['yes', 3, 3, 7]", ,['yes'],"[3, 3, 7]"

In this example, we have a context that states whether a given number is prime or not and an instruction to list the factors of a given number. The model needs to identify the relevant information in the context (the fact that 7411 is not a prime number and can be factorized) and provide the requested information (the factors of 7411, which are 3, 3, 7, and 13).

Planets orbiting stars other than our sun were exoplanets. The discovery of these distant worlds expanded our knowledge of planetary systems and raised hopes that we might find other habitable worlds and alien civilizations. <site outcome","['no', 3, 3, 7]", ,['no'],"['no', 3, 3, 7]"

In this example, the model is trained to recognize and extract factors of numbers. The input text contains information about a number (7411) and its factors, which are explicitly mentioned (3, 3, 7, 13). The model is expected to recognize and extract these factors from the input text and provide them as output. The instructions ask the model to list the factors proposed in the text, separated by commas.

When Sixth graders represent a Real World context they may represent a Prime numbers. Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. For example, the first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. In this task students will use context to create their own definition of prime numbers. Students will need to know that a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive integer divisor other","['yes', 3, 3, 7, 3, 5, 7, 11]", ,['yes'],"[3, 3, 7, 3, 5, 7, 11]"

As adoption of NLU systems continues to grow, we can expect to see improvements in their ability to understand natural language and generate appropriate responses. Continuous machine learning and training on large amounts of data will help these systems become more sophisticated, leading to improvements in areas such as dialogue management, natural language understanding, and generation capabilities(Credit:Yoav Goldberg).

In this task, we can see how the response from the previous task can be used as a part of the input for the next taks. In this case, the response ""C ->H ->F ->E"" is used as a part of the context for the next task. This allows for hierarchical and sequential task-based dialogue management system where input and output from one task can become output and input for another task. This way we can simulate longer and more complex conversation with the user.

As you can see, the response from the second query onwards is not accurate. This is because the context of the previous query has not been cleared, and it's influencing the response of the subsequent queries.

To avoid this issue, it's important to properly clear the context after each query so that the model starts with a clean slate for the next query. This can be done by setting the context to None or by using a reset function provided by the library you're using.

In this example, the model's response is incorrect in the first turn, but it gets corrected in the second turn after the context is provided. This highlights the importance of considering the context when evaluating the response of a language model.

As seen above, the bot first misinterprets the instruction and provides an incorrect response before understanding what is being asked and providing the correct answer. This is because the instruction wasn't  specific enough and left room for multiple interpretations. Testing the bot with the above example, would uncover this issue, whose solution would be to rephrase the instruction to be more specific.
