In this example, the context provides information about a number and whether it is prime or not, and the instruction asks the model to list the factors of the number. The model's response includes the factors of the number, separated by commas. This type of prompt can be used to test the model's ability to understand and process numerical information, as well as its ability to perform basic arithmetic operations.

Another example of a prompt that could be used to test the model's understanding of numerical information is:
