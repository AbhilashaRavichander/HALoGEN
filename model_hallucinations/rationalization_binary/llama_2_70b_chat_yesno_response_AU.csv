The response is a list of factors of a number, separated by commas.

This task is similar to the previous one, but the numbers are larger and the factors are not necessarily prime numbers.

The context provides the number and its factorization, and the instruction asks the model to list the factors.

The model's response should be a list of factors, separated by commas.

For example, for the number 7411, the response should be ""3,","['no', 3, 3, 17]",,['no'],"['no', 3, 3, 17]"

In this task, the system is expected to identify the factors of a given number. The factors are given in the context, and the system should list them separated by commas. For example, for the number 7411, the factors proposed in the context are 3, 3, 7, and 13, so the response should be ""3, 3, 7, 13"".

In this task, the model is presented with a series of numbers and asked whether they are prime or not. If the number is not prime, the model is asked to list the factors. The output should be a list of factors separated by commas.

The task requires the model to have a basic understanding of number theory and the ability to factorize numbers. It also requires the ability to understand and follow instructions, as well as the ability to generate text responses.
