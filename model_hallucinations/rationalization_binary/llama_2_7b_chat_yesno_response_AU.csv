In this example, the instruction is the same for both contexts, but the response changes depending on whether the number is prime or not. The model needs to be able to recognize the different responses and adapt to the context.

Another challenge is that the instructions and responses may contain different types of information, such as numbers, words, or phrases. The model needs to be able to process and understand this information in a way that allows it to generate appropriate responses.

In this example, the context provides information about numbers and asks the model to identify the factors of those numbers. The model's response is based on the information provided in the context.

This type of task requires the ability to understand the context, identify the relevant information, and provide an appropriate response. It is a good way to test a model's ability to process and understand natural language.

Another example of a context-dependent task is question answering. In this task,",['yes'],,['yes'],[]

```

In this task, the system is presented with a number and asked to determine whether it is prime or not. If it is not prime, the system is asked to provide the factors. If it is prime, the system is asked to provide no factors. The system's response is then evaluated based on whether it correctly identified the factors or lack thereof.

This task requires the system to have a basic understanding of number theory and the ability to factor numbers. It also requires the system to be able to understand and respond to natural language instructions.

In this task, the model is expected to identify the factors of a given number. The factors are proposed in the context and the model should list them separated by commas. The model's response should match the factors proposed in the context.

The model's performance can be evaluated based on its ability to accurately list the factors of a given number. The evaluation metric can be set to ""exact_match"", which means that the model's response should exactly match the factors proposed in the context.

In this task, the model is given a text context and a prompt asking for a list of factors. The model's response is then evaluated based on its accuracy in listing the factors.

The task is designed to test the model's ability to understand and process numerical information, as well as its ability to identify prime numbers and factorize composite numbers. It also tests the model's ability to understand the concept of ""none"" as a valid response when a number has no factors other than 1 and itself.

This is just a sample and you can add more such questions to your dataset. You can also include questions that involve more complex mathematical operations like square roots, exponents, etc.

Once you have a good amount of data, you can train your AI model using this data. You can use a machine learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build a neural network that can take in a mathematical expression and output the factors.
