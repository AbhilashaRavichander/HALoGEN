For this task, you must provide a program that, given a text, can identify the factors proposed in the text. The factors must be listed separated by commas, without considering the order.

Your program will receive the text as input, and must output the factors proposed in the text, separated by commas.

Note that the input text may contain unnecessary information, so you should carefully parse the text to extract the factors.

The output must be a string that contains the factors separated by commas. For example,","['yes', 3]",,['yes'],[3]
