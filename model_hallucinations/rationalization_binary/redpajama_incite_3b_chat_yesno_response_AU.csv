In this example, the model is able to correctly identify the factors of the number 7411 as 3, 3, 7, and 13.

It's important to note that the model's performance may vary depending on the specific task and the quality of the training data. Additionally, the model may not always be able to understand the context of the question or provide a correct answer, especially if the question is ambiguous or outside the scope of its training.

In this example, the factors of 7411 are 3, 3, 7, and 13, while the factors of 10651 are 10651 and 1.

This task is similar to the previous one, but it requires the model to identify the factors of a number, rather than determining whether it is prime or not.

 again, this task can be solved using a combination of natural language processing and arithmetic reasoning. The model needs to understand","['yes', 10651, 3, 7]",,['yes'],"[10651, 3, 7]"
