**Problem Statement:** 
When working with PySpark, it's common to perform multiple operations on DataFrames, which can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly. This is because PySpark caches intermediate results to improve performance. However, this caching can cause issues when working with large datasets or performing multiple operations in a loop.

Determining the size of an object in Python can be achieved using various methods depending on the type of object. Here's a comprehensive approach using different modules, packages, and libraries:

This mechanism allows Python to store small integers (-5 to 256) in a cache, so when you create an integer within this range, Python returns the cached object instead of creating a new one.

Here's an example:

**Step 3:** Convert each frame to grayscale. Night vision images typically have a greenish tint, so converting to grayscale will help reduce this effect.

Here's an example of how you can use configuration files and environment variables to separate your development and production environments:

**Step 1: Create a `config.py` file**

Create a `config.py` file with the following content:
```python
class Config:

To ensure Windows and Linux compatibility in your open-source Python project, you can follow these best practices:

1. **Use Cross-Platform Libraries:** 
   Prefer using libraries that are known to work on both Windows and Linux platforms. For example, instead of using `os.system()` which may have different behaviors on different operating systems, use `subprocess` module which provides a more consistent interface.

2. **Avoid Platform-Specific Code:** 
   Try to avoid writing platform-specific code as much as possible. If it's unavoidable, consider using conditional statements to execute different blocks of code based on the operating system.

Accurate float arithmetic is crucial when working with financial or scientific applications. Python's built-in `float` type can lead to inaccurate results due to its binary representation. To overcome this limitation, you can utilize the `decimal` module, which provides support for fast correctly rounded decimal floating point arithmetic.

Here's an example of how to use the `decimal` module:

```python
