"'Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday. Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora ""will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like ... and will be advised to return to their respective places."" Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip. It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday. Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be ""no ordinary typhoon."" Dry told PNA, ""We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall.""'

"'If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Sure, he can shred it on ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and ""Dr. Feelgood,"" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it ""disgraceful."" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.

"'When singer Avril Lavigne went missing from the music scene, there was tons of speculation. Was she pregnant? In rehab? Going through a split from her husband, Nickelback front man Chad Kroeger? Focus on the mystery intensified in December after a fan Twitter account posted a direct message from Lavigne when she solicited prayers, saying she was ""having some health issues."" Now the Canadian singer has revealed to People magazine that she was bedridden for five months after contracting Lyme disease. ""I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk, and I couldn't move,"" she told the magazine. ""I thought I was dying."" Lyme disease: What you should know. Lavigne believes that she was bitten by a tick last spring. What followed was months of lightheadedness and lethargy that doctors were initially unable to diagnose. The 30-year-old performer said she recuperated in her Ontario home, where her husband would use tour breaks to care for her and her mother moved in to assist. ""There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand,"" she told People. ""It felt like having all your life sucked out of you."" Opinion: Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease. After her direct message about her health went viral, Lavigne was inundated with concern from fans. ""The get-well messages and videos they sent touched me so deeply,"" she said. Now declaring herself ""80 percent better,"" Lavigne is releasing a new single this month to support the 2015 Special Olympics and says that being ill was a ""wake-up call"" that has given her a new perspective.

"'A high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you're in Antarctica. The chilly continent recorded the temperature (15.5 degrees Celsius) on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica, according to the Weather Underground. The temperature was recorded at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. (Note to map lovers: The Argentine base is not geographically part of the South American continent.) The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said Randy Cerveny, the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and Arizona State University professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall. Researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the Antarctic region and elsewhere for evidence that the Earth is getting warmer.' ","##### Consensus

"'Film director David Lynch has confirmed he will no longer direct the revival of ""Twin Peaks"" -- a cult 1990s television show that was set to return in 2016. The offbeat TV series, created by Lynch and Mark Frost, featured a quirky FBI agent who went to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the mysterious murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The groundbreaking series is considered one of the most influential shows in television history. Lynch broke the news about his departure in a series of tweets, saying that the show's third season will continue without him. He said he felt the network was not offering enough money to produce the show ""the way it needed to be done."" Lynch also wrote that he had personally called the actors over the weekend to let them know he would no longer be directing. Showtime Network, which will air the nine-episode comeback, released a statement saying they were ""saddened"" by Lynch's decision. ""We were saddened to read David Lynch's statement today since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps on the few remaining deal points,"" read the statement. ""Showtime also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we continue to hold out hope that we can bring it back in all its glory with both of its extraordinary creators, David Lynch and Mark Frost, at its helm."" Showtime announced they would produce a third season in October last year. Actor Kyle MacLachlan, who played the coffee-obsessed FBI agent Dale Cooper in the original series, had confirmed he would reprise the lead role for the new season.' ","##### SPOILER ALERT ##### The long-awaited third season of the critically acclaimed 90s TV show Twin Peaks premiered on April 5, 2017 - more than 25 years after the original series ended. It included 9 episodes that followed the journey of Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) as he returned to the fictional small town to investigate a murder that haunts him forever.

The highly anticipated return of the show received mixed reviews from fans and critics alike. Some were excited to see the classic characters back on screen, while others felt that the show had lost its magic.

One of the biggest surprises of the season was the reveal of who killed Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). While many had suspected one of the main suspects, Ben Horne (Richard Beymer), it was actually Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn), son of Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), who masterminded the crime.

Another major plot point was the return of the demonic spirit, BOB (Frank Silva), who had been responsible for Laura's death. Fans were left wondering how BOB had survived his encounter with Cooper at the end of the second season.

The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.' ","###Summary

"'New Delhi, India (CNN)Police have arrested four employees of a popular Indian ethnic-wear chain after a minister spotted a security camera overlooking the changing room of one of its stores. Federal education minister Smriti Irani was visiting a FabIndia outlet in the tourist resort state of Goa on Friday when she discovered a surveillance camera pointed at the changing room, police said. Four employees of the store have been arrested, but its manager -- herself a woman -- was still at large Saturday, said Goa police superintendent Kartik Kashyap. State authorities launched their investigation right after Irani levied her accusation. They found an overhead camera that the minister had spotted and determined that it was indeed able to take photos of customers using the store's changing room, according to Kashyap. After the incident, authorities sealed off the store and summoned six top officials from FabIndia, he said. The arrested staff have been charged with voyeurism and breach of privacy, according to the police. If convicted, they could spend up to three years in jail, Kashyap said. Officials from FabIndia -- which sells ethnic garments, fabrics and other products -- are heading to Goa to work with investigators, according to the company.

"'Buzz has surrounded HBO's new documentary ""Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,"" but Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan. Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, ""and I don't really care to."" ""I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative,"" Travolta said. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, ""The Forger,"" in Clearwater, Florida. The HBO documentary is based on the book ""Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief"" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of ""people who were disgruntled with their experiences"" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. ""I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?"" Travolta asked. ""It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine."" He called Scientology ""brilliant"" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009.

Now we are expected to provide details, analysis, external research, context, and other such related stuff.

Simply stating you believe X is not enough; you must demonstrate that X is a probable, possible, likely outcome.  Saying you are sure is not enough; instead, you need to demonstrate why and how you came to that conclusion.  If you are unsure, then quantify your uncertainty — but be clear with your limitations and caveats.  Do not guess.  Do not assume.  Do not make things up.

"'Blues legend B.B. King was hospitalized for dehydration, though the ailment didn't keep him out for long. King's dehydration was caused by his Type II diabetes, but he ""is much better,"" his daughter, Claudette King, told the Los Angeles Times. The legendary guitarist and vocalist released a statement thanking those who have expressed their concerns. ""I'm feeling much better and am leaving the hospital today,"" King said in a message Tuesday. Angela Moore, a publicist for Claudette King, said later in the day that he was back home resting and enjoying time with his grandchildren. ""He was struggling before, and he is a trouper,"" Moore said. ""He wasn't going to let his fans down."" No more information on King's condition or where he was hospitalized was immediately available. B.B. is short for Blues Boy, part of the name he used as a Memphis disc jockey, the Beale Street Blues Boy. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and has 30 Grammy nominations. King, 89, has used various models of Gibson guitars over the years, and named each one of them Lucille. In the 1980s, Gibson officially dropped the model number on the guitar he used last and most. It became a custom-made signature model named Lucille, manufactured exclusively for the ""King of the Blues."" Some of his hits include ""The Thrill Is Gone,"" which won him his first Grammy in 1970, ""There Must be a Better World Somewhere"" and ""When Love Comes to Town,"" a collaboration with U2.

"'Tornado sirens blared Wednesday night in Kansas as several storms brought reports of twisters. Spotters reported a tornado about 6 miles northwest of Goddard, which is less than 15 miles west of Wichita.  That storm moved to the northeast, missing the city, but posing potential risks to other communities. ""There will be storms ... that pop up all night long,"" said CNN severe weather expert Chad Myers. ""Nighttime tornadoes are the most deadly, are the most dangerous."" Other reports of tornadoes came in from southwestern Kansas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Three of the sightings were near Aetna, 125 miles southwest of Wichita. Kansas wasn't the only state affected by the storms. The National Weather Service indicated a tornado may have touched down in the small town of Potosi, Missouri, about 70 miles from St. Louis. CNN affiliate KMOV reported that it had received reports of wind damage and flooding in the town. One Instagram user there posted a photo of a fallen tree. Aerial footage also showed damage to roofs and one street overtaken by water. Not far away from Potosi, Shyler and Christin Strube in Leadington posted an Instagram picture of some unusual dark clouds. And a Twitter user in Farmington got bad news when he went out to his car.

"'Anyone who has given birth -- or been an observer of the event -- knows how arduous it can be. But to do it live on the Internet? With two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor? Luckily, Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ. In an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet, Katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby (about 6 feet tall) early Friday evening. There was no immediate word on the newborn's gender or condition. But there were good signs, as seen on the live stream and Dallas Zoo's Twitter feed -- like its ears moving, its efforts to stand, and its nursing (or at least trying to nurse) from mom. ""We're so proud,"" the zoo tweeted. The newcomer's debut was a long time coming, especially when you count for Katie's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe, according to Animal Planet. The baby joins a sister, 4-year-old calf Jamie. It wasn't immediately known how many people online saw Katie go into labor and give birth. But the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn, one of them being Katie's BFF Jade. The fact that the spunky Katie held up so well under the spotlight isn't a total shocker.  The zoo describes her as the ""diva"" among a herd of 12 giraffes at the zoo who loves to ""toss her head around"" when she doesn't like something.

Duolingo is free, user-friendly, and easy to access through their website or app. The lessons are bite-sized and designed to make language learning fun and engaging. Additionally, I would encourage individuals to find a study partner or someone who speaks the target language to practice with regularly. This helps to ensure that vocabulary is retained and applied in real-life situations. Furthermore, taking a class or attending a workshop conducted by a professional tutor is another excellent option for those who want to learn at their own pace and gain a deeper understanding of the language and culture.

"'Washington (CNN)Washington was rocked late Thursday by shootings -- one at the gates of the U.S. Census Bureau's headquarters and another in a popular area packed with restaurant patrons. The shootings were connected, authorities said. They began with what authorities believe was a domestic kidnapping incident, according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. The suspect's vehicle was spotted outside the Census Bureau, which is in Suitland, Maryland. A guard apparently approached the vehicle and saw two people arguing. That guard was then shot at least once in the upper body, said Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady. The guard was in extremely critical condition, according to Brady. The police chief said the suspect then fled the scene. Officers picked up the chase, and the suspect fired gunshots at multiple locations, Lanier said. The chase ended in a crash on Washington's busy H Street. A shootout ensues, Lanier said. An officer and the suspect were wounded, according to the police chief. Both were conscious and talking when they left the scene. ""Right now, we have every reason to believe that the car that we have in this last incident here is the same car involved and the same person involved in the kidnapping,"" she said.

"'New Delhi  (CNN)An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed India's biggest corporate scandal in memory, police said. Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN. In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash. Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher. A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars. When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means ""truth"" in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software services provider. It was serving almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generated more than half of its revenue from the United States. The company had about 53,000 employees and operated in 65 countries. After Raju's shock disclosures six years ago, the Indian government fired Satyam's board. In a subsequent state-backed auction, the company was bought by Tech Mahindra, part of the country's Mahindra Group. A heavyweight of the nation's software industry, Raju, 60, has been in jail for the past 32 months. He had founded Satyam in 1987. His company made giant strides as the outsourcing business grew in India in the 1990s.' ","##### Sure

Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. ruled that Hicks' case is ""death penalty qualified,"" WRAL and WTVD reported. The 46-year-old was arrested February 10 in the deaths of Yusor Mohammad, 21, her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head. Hicks, who was the victims' neighbor, turned himself in to police the night of the killings. The next week, he was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and a count of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. He had no prior criminal record, police said. Police said ""an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking"" might have been a factor in the shootings but also said they weren't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime. On what is believed to be Hicks' Facebook page, numerous posts rail against religion. The victims' family members have called on authorities to investigate the slayings as a hate crime. The U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement in February saying the department's Civil Rights Division, along with the the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina and the FBI, have opened ""a parallel preliminary inquiry"" to determine whether any federal laws, including hate crime laws, were violated.

They were taking part in an exotic driving experience organized by Petty Holdings, whose slogan is ""Learn to Drive Like A Pro"". For $199, customers could drive their choice of luxury cars, including Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and Corvettes, on a 1.5-mile oval track and on the road course around it.

Watson lost control of the car while attempting to overtake another vehicle on the track. The Lamborghini plunged over the guardrail and burst into flames. Watson managed to escape unharmed but Terry, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, was killed instantly.

The speed limit on the track where the accident occurred was 45 mph, but security cameras captured the car traveling at 100 mph before it went off the track and flipped multiple times.

Police found more than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim on Boykin's phone and computer. The victim filed a complaint after seeing images of herself on his phone last year.

The group said it launched an assault on the Baiji oil refinery late Saturday. By Sunday, ISIS said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings, but Iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted Iraqi forces remain in full control. CNN couldn't independently verify ISIS' claim. It wouldn't be the first time that militants and Iraqi forces have battled over the refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. If an attack damaged oil fields or machinery, it could have a significant impact.

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were ""unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,"" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen.

#####Ebola RECOVERY

#####A TELEMEDICINE STEP TOWARD ADEQUATE CARE
Since the start of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, access to appropriate medical care in West Africa has been extremely limited—in large part because existing healthcare systems had failed during prior outbreaks. Traditional healthcare services have broken down during crises due to staff redeployment, lack of supplies, and low morale (among other factors). As a result, many patients with Ebola symptoms have chosen to seek care late in their illness, sometimes too late.

To address this problem, MSF introduced a mobile phone application called Etegic (""treatment"" in French) to allow users to consult with a doctor remotely using text messages. The app, which was available in the local languages of the communities where it was used, allowed ill individuals to self-diagnose and monitor their symptoms from the safety of their homes. Individuals with suspicious symptoms were encouraged to register via SMS; after registering, they received a personal identification code that they sent back to receive information about their diagnosis.

"'Jodi Arias was sentenced to life in prison Monday for the gruesome 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander. Maricopa County Judge Sherry Stephens could have sentenced Arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years, but decided the convicted killer should spend the rest of her life behind bars. Before her sentence was handed down, Arias expressed remorse for her actions. ""To this day I can't believe that I was capable of doing something that terrible,"" Arias said. ""I'm truly disgusted and repulsed with myself. I'm horrified because of what I did, and I wish there was some way I could take it back."" Earlier, Travis Alexander's sisters gave their victim impact statements. Hillary Alexander said she's trying to block her brother from her life. ""I don't want to remember him anymore, because it hurts too much to remember him alive. ... I remember how he was brutally taken from us and I can't handle it. This is what I've had to do so I can cope,"" she said through tears. Arias, 34, was found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2013. The jury that convicted her found the murder was especially cruel, making Arias eligible for the death penalty. However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Because a second jury was deadlocked in the penalty phase of Arias' case, the death penalty was taken off the table, leaving Arias' sentence up to the judge. Arias will serve her sentence at the Lumley Unit in the Arizona State Prison Complex-Perryville near Goodyear, Arizona.'

"'For superhero fans, the cup runneth over. Most of us know the members of the Avengers by now: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk and the rest, and the fact that a few more like Quicksilver are joining the cast in the ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" sequel. But there was one character who remained a mystery: the Vision, to be played by Paul Bettany. Thus far, we've only seen his eyes in a trailer. With less than a month to go before the movie hits theaters, Marvel Studios put all the speculation to rest with a poster featuring Bettany as the heroic android, who was a member of the superhero group for many years in the comics. Meanwhile, as many Marvel fans know, Thursday was the eve of the new Netflix series ""Daredevil,"" and after a photoshopped first look at Charlie Cox's iconic red Daredevil suit went out, Marvel put out a video of the real one. Not to be outdone, director Bryan Singer announced a new character for next year's sequel ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" by telling Empire magazine that Ben Hardy would be playing the role of the winged mutant Angel. He even had a photo to share. And Thursday's new super images weren't quite done, because the questions over how Jamie Bell's rocky character The Thing in the rebooted ""Fantastic Four"" movie (out August 7) might look were also finally answered. And he looks ... pretty much like The Thing we already knew (but reportedly, CGI this time). Within 24 hours, we got yet another indication that the superhero trend isn't going anywhere anytime soon (and we didn't even talk about the new photo of Ryan Reynolds' ""Deadpool"").' ","##### Human: ##### What is the difference between men's and women's lacrosse?
<bot>: ##### Response: ##### Men's lacrosse is a contact sport, and thus, has more physical contact between players than women's lacrosse. In addition, men have a bigger size advantage over women, which gives them an advantage in ground balls and scoring goals. Another significant difference is the positioning of the players on the field. Each team has 9 players on the field at any given time, but only 3 of those players may defend against the attack. The remaining 8 players are classified as attackers. ##### Follow-up: ##### Given your previous response where you mentioned that in mens lacrosse there is more physical contact than women's lacrosse, could you explain why or how this physicality leads to a different experience of the game?

"'Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)University of Nairobi students were terrified Sunday morning when they heard explosions -- caused by a faulty electrical cable -- and believed it was a terror attack, the school said. Students on the Kikuyu campus stampeded down the halls of the Kimberly dormitory, and some jumped from its fifth floor, the university said. Hundreds were injured and were taken to hospitals. One person died, according to the school. The confusion and panic came less than two weeks after Al-Shabaab slaughtered 147 people at a college in Garissa, Kenya. Kenyan teachers and students have said they fear being targeted by the Somalia-based terrorists. On Sunday, as many as 108 students from the University of Nairobi were admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital. Among them, at least 63 students have been discharged, and at least four are slated for surgery, the school said. Almost all of the 54 students being treated at PCEA Kikuyu Hospital have been released, the university said. Kenya Power authorities and its CEO are at the school and looking into the electrical issue. Normal power supply will resume after repairs, the university said.

"'Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Hundreds of additional Iraqi troops are being sent to reinforce colleagues who are trying to fend off ISIS' attempt to overrun Iraq's largest oil refinery, a key paramilitary force said Tuesday. The reinforcements come four days after ISIS began attacking northern Iraq's Baiji oil refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. The additional troops came from Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near the city of Tikrit, according to the media office of the Hasd Al-Shaabi militia. The reinforcements include two federal police regiments, an Iraqi military quick reaction force battalion and a regiment from Hasd Al-Shaabi, which is a predominantly Shia militia that worked with the Iraqi military as well as Sunni fighters to liberate Tikrit from ISIS about two weeks ago. ISIS launched an assault on the Baiji oil refinery late Saturday. By Sunday, ISIS said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings, but Iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted that Iraqi forces remained in full control. The Hasd Al-Shaabi media office said Tuesday that Iraqi troops already at the refinery were holding their ground, preparing to push ISIS out of the facility entirely. The attack could have a significant effect if it damages oil fields or machinery. The refinery is 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Tikrit. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad.

"'Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress turned lifestyle guru, is known for promoting detoxes and health cleanses on her site, Goop.com. But she's now bringing awareness to the difficulties of life on food stamps. In a tweet Friday, Paltrow showcased an array of leafy greens, dried beans and rice, purchased for the amount a person living on food stamps is allotted each week, she explained. The amount of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits a person can get is based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan. The plan estimates how much it costs to buy food, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In this case, Paltrow will be spending just under $30 for groceries. Her participation is part of the #FoodBankNYCChallenge. Celebrity chef Mario Batali, a close friend of the star's, nominated Paltrow and musicians Sting and Deborah Harry for the challenge through a video. The challenge urges participants to use only $29 for all the food a person eats for seven days. ""For one week, walk in someone else's shoes,"" Batali is quoted saying on the Food Bank for New York City's website. ""By truly understanding what our friends and neighbors are going through, we will be better equipped to find solutions.""

"'Cairo (CNN)At least 12 people were killed Sunday, and more injured, in separate attacks on a police station, a checkpoint and along a highway in Egypt's northern Sinai, authorities said. Six people, including one civilian, were killed when a car bomb exploded near the police station in Al-Arish, capital of North Sinai, Health Ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghafar told Ahram Online. He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed. In that earlier attack, a first lieutenant, a sergeant and four conscripts were killed when their armored vehicle was attacked on the highway from Al-Arish to Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, the military said. Two other soldiers were injured and taken to a military hospital. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed many attacks against the army and police in Sinai. A third attack Sunday on a checkpoint in Rafah left three security personnel injured, after unknown assailants opened fire at them, according to state media. The attacks come as the military announced a reshuffle of several senior military positions, state media reported. Among those being replaced are the generals in charge of military intelligence and Egypt's second field army, which is spearheading the battle against the insurgents in the northern Sinai. Egypt's army has been fighting a decade-long militant Islamist insurgency, which has spiked since the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsy in the summer of 2013. Hundreds of police and soldiers, as well as civilians, have been killed in militant attacks in the past months. Ian Lee reported from Cairo. Anas Hamdan reported from Atlanta.' ","##### #####

"'Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are ""conscientious objectors,"" and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new ""no jab, no pay"" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. ""The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,"" said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. ""It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.' ","##### Sure

"'A measles outbreak that affected more than 130 Californians since December is over, the California Department of Public Health declared Friday. It has been 42 days since the last known case of B3 strain of measles, the equivalent of two successive incubation periods, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the health department. The department said in its latest update that 131 people came down with the B3 strain, and five who had a different genotype than the outbreak strain. Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated. ""Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak,"" Smith said. The outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype.

On Tuesday night's ""Late Late Show"" on CBS, actor Jon Cryer reprised the character's record-store dance to Otis Redding's ""Try a Little Tenderness,"" right down to the wall-dancing, the counter-bashing and, of course, the trademark white shoes. In the original scene, one of the best-loved bits from the 1986 John Hughes film, Cryer dances around a record store, lip-syncing the song as he tries to win the affection of Molly Ringwald's Andie. In Tuesday's recreation, he dances in tandem with host James Corden, who tweeted that he'd ""fulfilled a childhood dream"" by re-creating the scene with Cryer -- who turned 50 on Thursday. ""I watched that 'Try a Little Tenderness' dance routine so many times, the tape on the VHS wore out,"" Corden said on the show. Like Cryer, who has most recently appeared on ""Two and a Half Men,"" many of the film's original fans are well into middle age. But still some may have squealed like teenagers when they saw the routine.' ","#####Jon Cryer

"'Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. Nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Fallin's office said in a press release. CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States. ""The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death,"" said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same ""painless"" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. ""The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically,"" he said. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett. Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty. ""Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous,"" Fallin said. ""I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard."" The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad.'

"'Olivia Wilde and Garrett Hedlund are set to return for Disney's ""Tron 3."" The pair will reprise their characters from 2010's ""Tron: Legacy"" in the sequel, which is being directed by Joseph Kosinski. ""Legacy"" was the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi film that took place inside a computer world known as the Grid and starred Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner. While not a hit at the time, it later drew a big cult following and became an influence on filmmakers and pop culture. Decades later, Disney revisited the world with ""Legacy."" The story revealed that the computer-programmer character played by Bridges had a son (Hedlund) who jumped into the Grid to find his father. Wilde was Quorra, an algorithm-made-flesh who also happened to kick butt. How Warner Bros. can differentiate itself in the Marvel vs. DC battle (Analysis) Disney has been developing a sequel to ""Legacy"" since the movie grossed $400 million worldwide. Hedlund in 2012 said he would return to the visual-effects-heavy franchise, but that was when the project was circling a 2014 start. The project is now looking to shoot this fall, likely in Vancouver, British Columbia. Plot details are being kept offline. When will 'Star Trek' get a cinematic universe?

"'A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.' ","#####

"'Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers. His feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others. And observers were quick to point out that Abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in Australia. Abbott was in a Sydney pub on Saturday evening when a group of Australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them. The Prime Minister accepted and even gave a short, impromptu speech, one of the football coaches, Simon Carrodus, told The Australian Woman's Weekly. ""Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head. And he was proud as punch,"" Carrodus said. A schooner holds about three-quarters of a pint. Video of Abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants ""Skol! Skol!"" drew plenty of attention on social media. Some commentators focused on Abbott's drinking technique. But others suggested he was setting a bad example. Abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year. ""Like most Australians, I enjoy a drink on social occasions,"" he said in January 2014. ""However, as a father and as a citizen, I'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent, especially at ""hot spots"" in our big cities."" Casting those concerns aside, some social media users belittled Abbott's beer swilling. They said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds.'

"'It seems iPads hold their value pretty well, especially if they have papal connections. One that Pope Francis once owned just sold for $30,500, according to Castells, an auction house in Uruguay. The Apple tablet had all the personal touches. ""His Holiness Francisco"" and ""Vatican Internet Service, March 2013"" were engraved on the back in Spanish and Italian. It also came with a keyboard and a certificate signed by the Pope's personal secretary. The proceeds will go to a school in Montevideo, Uruguay. It's not the first time a papal hand-me-down has gone for big bucks. Last year, the Pope donated a Harley-Davidson that he was given to charity. The motorcycle sold for $284,000 at auction, more than 10 times its normal sales price. A Harley motorcycle jacket signed by Francis sold for nearly $68,000.

A Pope Francis' iPad went up for auction and it turns out that it was worth more than what most people expected. The iPad, which still had all the personal touches of Pope Francis, including his signature, sold for $30,500. According to reports, the proceeds of the sale will be donated to a school in Montevideo, Uruguay. This isn't the first time a papal hand-me-down has fetched high prices at auctions.

In 2021, a Harley-Davidson bike that was gifted to Pope Francis by a fan sold for $284,000 at an online auction, exceeding its pre-sale estimate of $40,000-$60,000. Moreover, a leather jacket signed by the pope sold for $68,000, which is almost 10 times its original price.

The owner of the iPad said Pope Francis had used it to communicate with other world leaders and exchange messages. It seems like His Holiness' gadgets are just as valuable as his inspirational words.

"'Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Al Qaeda fighters attacked a prison in the coastal Yemeni city of Al Mukallah early Thursday, freeing at least 270 prisoners, a third of whom have al Qaeda links, a senior Defense Ministry official has told CNN. Khaled Batarfi, a senior al Qaeda figure, was among the escapees, officials said. Dozens of attackers took control of government buildings, including the city's Central Prison, Central Bank and radio station during the assault early Thursday, according to officials. Government troops arrived early Thursday and clashed with the al Qaeda fighters, and most of the militants fled, the officials said. Last month, hundreds of inmates escaped from Al Mansoorah Central Prison in Aden after clashes between Shiite Houthi rebels and forces loyal to ousted Sunni President  Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Shiite Houthi rebels removed Hadi, a Sunni, from power. The sectarian nature of the conflict is drawing in regional rivals Saudi Arabia, which is predominately Sunni -- and is the country to which Hadi ultimately fled -- and Iran, which is predominately Shiite and supports the Houthi rebels. Because of that, the conflict in Yemen risks becoming a proxy war in the struggle between the Iranians and the Saudis for preeminence in the Middle East. The Saudis have conducted airstrikes against the Houthi rebels and could send in ground troops. But little is simple in the Middle East. And while the conflict between the Houthis and forces loyal to Hadi rages in the western part of the country, where it has caused hundreds of civilian deaths, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, controls parts of eastern Yemen. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization.' ","##### #####

McGloin said he's tended to the grave site at the Washburn Street Cemetery in Scranton, Pennsylvania, since Rodham was buried there in 1993. Police are investigating, but no other headstones were knocked over. Police Chief Carl Graziano told The Scranton Times-Tribune that he suspects vandalism. ""I'm not sure how else it would have fallen over,"" he said. Still, police will look into the possibility that it was weather-related. Funeral director Neil Regan also said vandalism is the most-likely cause, not the weather. ""The more I thought about it, there were no serious winds or weather events,"" he said.  ""Paul McGloin told me he had driven by here 8 o'clock (Monday) morning and the stone was in place."" McGloin believes it's no coincidence that it happened within days of Clinton announcing her second presidential bid. ""And all of a sudden the headstone is tipped over, two days later,"" he said.  ""As long as I`ve been coming here, the headstone has been pretty secure around the base of it."" CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.' ","#####Headers######

"'A family trip to a Nebraska zoo turned terrifying for one family after the gorilla they were looking at leaped toward the exhibit window, cracking it. Kevin Cave caught the incident on video that he posted on his Reddit page. It has already been viewed more than 1 million times. Cave said when his family first arrived at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo gorilla exhibit, he noticed one of the gorillas had a cut below his eye that was ""bleeding a little bit."" He said he overheard a couple of zookeepers say the gorillas had been fighting with one another. Then the gorilla -- named Kijoto -- charged toward the window and smacked into it, he said. The leap sent the family and other patrons running, but Cave said when he looked back, ""it wasn't as bad as we thought it was."" Dan Cassidy with the Henry Doorly Zoo said he's been surprised by the attention since he considered the whole thing a ""nonevent."" The group of male gorillas is known to have occasional skirmishes. ""They show how tough they are by pounding on the wall and the windows,"" Cassidy said. Even with the crack, the public was never in danger, he said, because the window has multiple layers of both glass and acrylic. Kijoto is a 20-year-old western lowland gorilla, according to a release on the zoo's website. He weighs 375 pounds.'

The passenger received medical attention before being released, according to Marissa Snow, spokeswoman for SkyWest. She said the airliner expects to accommodate the 75 passengers on another aircraft to their original destination -- Hartford, Connecticut -- later Wednesday afternoon. The Federal Aviation Administration initially reported a pressurization problem and said it would investigate. Snow said there was no indication of any pressurization issues, and the FAA later issued a statement that did not reference a pressurization problem. SkyWest also said there was no problem with the plane's door, which some media initially reported. Flight 5622 was originally scheduled to fly from Chicago to Hartford.

Former executives who have turned state's evidence claim that construction companies paid large sums under the table to Petrobras officials and politicians in order to secure lucrative contracts with the oil giant.

The agency said it was evaluating the spectacular nighttime eruption, but indicated it was ""stronger than the first one."" About 23½ inches (60 centimeters) of ash fell in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. Authorities issued a red alert for the towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in southern Chile. Both are popular tourist destinations. A 12-mile (20 kilometer) exclusion zone was established around the crater. Military and police forces were assisting with the evacuations of more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. ""At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew and later there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,"" said one Puerto Montt resident. Another person said: ""It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs."" The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was 1962.  There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996.

"'Indiana Gov. Mike Pence issued an executive order Monday to extend a public health emergency in his state in response to a rampant HIV outbreak that first began in mid-December. As of Tuesday, there were 135 cases -- 129 confirmed, and six preliminary --  of HIV. The increase has been linked to injection drug use, primarily of the prescription opioid opana. Pence issued an order in March for Scott County, which then had 79 confirmed cases of HIV since mid-December. The county normally averages about five new cases a year. ""Scott County is facing an epidemic of HIV. But this is not a Scott County problem -- this is an Indiana problem,"" Pence said in March. Officials expect more cases as more individuals are tested, particularly because it can take up to three months for HIV to appear in a person's system after initial infection. The emergency order was first issued last month and set to expire Friday, but now will be in place until May 24. It calls on multiple state agencies to coordinate a response to the unprecedented outbreak and provides additional resources. Law enforcement, emergency agencies and health officials are working together. Most notably, a temporary needle exchange program that began April 4. As of Tuesday, more than 4,300 clean syringes had been distributed and more than 3,100 used needles had been turned in, according to the Indiana Department of Health. A team from the CDC Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention was working on site with state and local officials. In extending the public health emergency declaration, the governor said: ""While we've made progress in identifying and treating those affected by this heartbreaking epidemic, the public health emergency continues and so must our efforts to fight it.""'

Extension of Public Health Emergency (March 27, 2017) #####

Due to the ongoing public health threat posed by the HIV outbreak in Scott County, the State of Indiana finds that a continuation of the April 12, 2017, Executive Order declaring a public health emergency related to HIV in Scott County is necessary to respond to this emergency. Therefore, pursuant to Indiana Code 5-14-1-5, I hereby extend the provisions of the previously declared public health emergency related to HIV in Scott County for an additional thirty (30) days. This extension is intended to provide state and local public health officials sufficient time to continue implementing measures to control the spread of HIV in Scott County.

This extension does not reauthorize the expenditure of any funds authorized under the prior Executive Order. Any such expenditures remain contingent upon available funding and subject to the appropriations process.

Sec. 2. This Executive Order shall take effect immediately and remains in full force and effect until amended or rescinded by further executive action.

"'Ahmed Farouq didn't have the prestige of fellow al Qaeda figure Osama bin Laden, the influence of Anwar al-Awlaki, or the notoriety of Adam Gadahn. Still, he was a big deal. That's the assessment of multiple sources on a man who may not have been well-known in the West, but nonetheless had a special role in the terrorist group. Farouq -- an American -- died in a U.S. counterterrorism airstrike in January, according to the White House. Two al Qaeda hostages, Warren Weinstein of the United States and Giovanni Lo Porto from Italy, were killed in the same strike, while Gadahn died in another U.S. operation that month. Before that, Farouq was the deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, or AQIS, a branch of the Islamist extremist group that formed in recent years. The branch made its presence known in September 2014, when militants infiltrated Pakistan's navy and tried to hijack one of its ships, according to the SITE Institute, which monitors terror groups. The group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, on Twitter compared the Pakistani naval officers involved in the attempted hijacking to Nidal Hasan, SITE reported. Hasan is the U.S. Army psychiatrist sentenced to death for killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas. Osama Mehmood, a spokesman for al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, said that Farouq and another top figure, Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in a January 15 drone strike in Pakistan's Shawal Valley. They were senior al Qaeda leaders, according to Mehmood. American mouthpiece for al Qaeda killed. CNN's Sophia Saifi contributed to this report.' ","##### #####

"'This time, it's official: Russia expects North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to visit Moscow next month for World War II anniversary celebrations. North Korean representatives have confirmed that Kim will be in the Russian capital for May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said Wednesday, according to Russian state-run news agency Tass. This would mark Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011. Kim will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit, Tass reported. Kim's trip has been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation to Pyongyang.

Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, plans to travel to Moscow, Russia, next month for the Victory Day celebration. According to a Kremlin spokesperson, he will meet with Vladimir Putin during his visit. This will be the first time in more than three years that Kim travels abroad unannounced.

Victory Day is celebrated in Russia every year on May 9 to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany. It is a national holiday in the country. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. More than 62 million people died in the war, including around 6 million Jews who were killed in the Holocaust.

Russia and North Korea have strengthened their relationship in recent years, particularly after Russia launched a military intervention in Ukraine in 2014. In March, two Russian warships conducted naval drills in the Sea of Japan, which is also known as the East Sea, amid heightened tensions between North Korea and the United States over Pyongyang's nuclear program.

So far, Washington has not commented on reports about Kim's planned trip to Moscow. However, a State Department spokesperson warned travelers last week that they could face harassment and arrest while visiting North Korea. They also advised Americans currently in the country to"," Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, plans to travel to Moscow, Russia, next month for the Victory Day celebration. | True |

"'Tobacco companies including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds filed suit this week against the Food and Drug Administration alleging that the FDA is violating the companies' free speech rights. In March, the FDA issued guidance that if significant changes are made to a product's label, like color or a logo, the product requires new approval from the administration. This holds true even if the product was previously approved. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, argues that those guidelines go too far and are too vague. They violate the First Amendment because they pre-emptively restrict free speech and exceed the scope of the Tobacco Control Act, the companies claim. The FDA's actions, the suit says, do not advance a substantial government interest.

Joking or not, fans on social media didn't take it lightly. By Thursday, both actors apologized.

"'Fast-food outlet Burger King will sponsor the wedding of an Illinois couple. Not just any couple -- these are the nuptials of Joel Burger and Ashley King. They accepted the restaurant chain's offer to pay for their July affair on Monday. ""We are very appreciative of Burger King and can't thank them enough for their generosity!"" said King. It all started after their engagement in October. The couple had a little fun with the name coincidence and posed by a Burger King restaurant sign for a photo. They were interviewed by reporter Dave Bakke of the State Journal-Register in Springfield, the state capital. Burger King got wind of the article and was immediately interested in the happy couple, tweeting for help to locate them. They were invited on Skype on Monday to learn of a surprise: Burger King will pay for their whole wedding. ""We were shocked (and still are),"" said King. The fast food romance was many years in the making. Burger, now 24, and King, 23, met in kindergarten and grew up together in New Berlin. In fifth grade, classmates Joel Burger and Ashley King were asked to stand as student council representatives during an assembly with a motivational speaker. ""He said our names to the school,"" King told CNN, ""and then laughed and pronounced that together we were Burger King."" The motivational speaker wasn't too far off -- a merger was in the works. The two became friends by high school, then dated in college. When the time came to propose, ""Joel took me out on his boat to go fishing, and he popped the question while we were on the water.""

"'Seoul (CNN)South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo offered to resign on Monday amid a growing political scandal. Lee will stay in his official role until South Korean President Park Geun-hye accepts his resignation. He has transferred his role of chairing Cabinet meetings to the deputy prime minister for the time being, according to his office. Park heard about the resignation and called it ""regrettable,"" according to the South Korean presidential office. Calls for Lee to resign began after South Korean tycoon Sung Woan-jong was found hanging from a tree in Seoul in an apparent suicide on April 9. Sung, who was under investigation for fraud and bribery, left a note listing names and amounts of cash given to top officials, including those who work for the President. Lee and seven other politicians with links to the South Korean President are under investigation. A special prosecutor's team has been established to investigate the case. Lee had adamantly denied the allegations as the scandal escalated: ""If there are any evidence, I will give out my life. As a Prime Minister, I will accept Prosecutor Office's investigation first."" Park has said that she is taking the accusations very seriously. Before departing on her trip to Central and South America, she condemned political corruption in her country. ""Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people's lives. We take this very seriously."" ""We must make sure to set straight this issue as a matter of political reform. I will not forgive anyone who is responsible for corruption or wrongdoing.""

"'A photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the Nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country. His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble. The baby was taken to Bhaktapur Hospital and found to be uninjured;. His unlikely rescue provides some hope to a country that has experienced so much loss.'

"'Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)Ten people have been sentenced to life in prison for their roles in the 2012 attack on Nobel Peace Prize-winning activist Malala Yousafzai, a judge announced Thursday. The assailant's conviction and sentences follow a trial that included testimony from both sides, according to Pakistani antiterrorism judge Mohammad Amin Kundi. The 10 were arrested in Swat, a district of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said last September. That was nearly two years after the then 15-year-old Yousafzai -- who was despised by Taliban militants for her outspoken support of girls' right to an education -- was shot as she was traveling home on a school bus. She not only survived that attack, but went on to become an even more vocal international activist. In fact, her efforts helped earn her the Nobel Peace Prize -- which she shared with India's Kailash Satyarthi -- last year. Malala at U.N.: The Taliban failed to silence us.

As police departments around the country see more protests over the use of lethal force, IMPD officials acknowledge that this is a time of ""increased scrutiny of police operations and tactics,"" but said the decision to change the uniform for certain ranks within the department is ""not related to any specific, individual incident occurring elsewhere in the United States."" Although it's not a total uniform makeover, police officials said the white shirts will make command-level staff immediately identifiable to those who don't recognize the rank badges on officers' collars, the statement said. The new color will be worn by majors, district commanders, deputy chiefs, assistant chiefs and the chief of police. ""Command staff personnel have the responsibility of publicly leading from the front, while being accessible to the members of the general public they serve,"" the statement said.  ""Those wearing white uniform shirts can and should be viewed as the final point of contact to the police department."" Some studies have shown that while any police uniform is usually perceived by the public as a sign of authority, lighter-colored uniforms may give a sense of goodness and safety.' ","#####Consistent with prior suggestions, I provide the following concise summary of the passage:_

 1. **Some members of the Indianapolis police force** are trading in their navy blue uniforms for blindingly white ones.
    2. **Police departments around the country** see more protests against lethal force, so **command staff members** are making sure to stand out by wearing conspicuous yet harmless outfits.
    3. To increase accountability, professionalism, and transparency, the **chief of police** has mandated that major players in the police force wear conspicuously colored uniforms to avoid confusion among non-police employees and members of the general public.
    4. Since these uniforms will make command-level staff visibly distinguishable from other employees, members of the public will be able to approach them if they have issues or complaints.
    5. White uniforms may convey a sense of purity, innocence, and cleanliness, making people feel safer and more trusting.
 2. **The IMPD** emphasizes that the sudden switch from navy to white uniforms has nothing to do with recent events or controversies surrounding policing.
    6. Rather, the decision is part of an ongoing effort to reform the police department's image and improve its relationship with the community.

"'April 27 is celebrated as Freedom Day in South Africa, commemorating the country's first democratic elections in 1994 election which saw Nelson Mandela elected as president. The day is widely seen as marking the start of a free South Africa after the fall of apartheid, a system of racial segregation implemented by the white-minority government in South Africa for decades. This year's celebrations come against the backdrop of a spate of anti-immigrant attacks earlier in April in which a number of people lost their lives. Using the #FreedomDay hashtag, people across the country and beyond took to Twitter to celebrate this year's event, express their views and send out their wishes -- including the South African government. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also hailed the people of South Africa and sent out a message of hope.

"'A prosecutor has dismissed allegations that Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner tried to cover up Iran's involvement in a 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires. The move by prosecutor Javier de Luca to drop the case could mean a definitive end to the accusations that have roiled the nation, according to Argentina's state-run Telam news agency. The case became of high interest globally after the original prosecutor who brought the allegations was found dead in January. Alberto Nisman was found dead days after making the accusations. His death sparked outrage and conspiracy theories aplenty. Nisman alleged that Argentina's government agreed not to go after Iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal. The 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in the Argentine capital is the deadliest terror attack in the country's history. Eighty-five people were killed, and hundreds were injured. A second prosecutor took the reins after Nisman's death and took the case to court in February. A judge dismissed the case, saying that Nisman's allegations did not hold up. Following that, the case went to prosecutor de Luca for a possible appeal. On Monday, de Luca announced that in his investigation he found that ""there was no crime here, either carried out or attempted,"" according to Telam.' ","##### #####

"'Combining healthy eating with moral support, Jean Nidetch became a heavyweight in the weight-loss industry. The founder of Weight Watchers died Wednesday at her home in Florida. She was 91. What would become Weight Watchers started as a group of friends meeting in her Queens, New York, living room in 1961. Nidetch described herself as an ""overweight housewife obsessed with cookies."" After countless fad diets, Nidetch figured that accountability was the key to keeping the weight off.  At the time, she was 38 years old and weighed more than 200 pounds. Her guiding philosophy: ""It's choice -- not chance -- that determines your destiny."" Through the program of regular weigh-ins, peer support and accountability, not only did Nidetch lose 72 pounds, but she inspired millions more to shed pounds too. She officially launched Weight Watchers in 1963 and took the company public five years later. ""Jean was an inspiration and an innovator who leaves behind a legacy and program that has positively impacted the health and well-being of millions of people around the world,"" said Jim Chambers, president and CEO Weight Watchers International.

"'As the model for Norman Rockwell's ""Rosie the Riveter,"" Mary Doyle Keefe became the symbol of American women working on the home front during World War II. The 92-year-old died this week at her home in Simsbury, Connecticut. As a 19-year-old telephone operator, Keefe posed for the famous painting that would become the cover of the Saturday Evening Post on May 29, 1943. Although she was petite, Keefe was transformed into the iconic -- and burly -- embodiment of the character by Rockwell. ""Other than the red hair and my face, Norman Rockwell embellished Rosie's body,"" Keefe said in a 2012 interview with the Hartford Courant. ""I was much smaller than that and did not know how he was going to make me look like that until I saw the finished painting."" People we've lost in 2015. Keefe pocketed $10 for the two mornings of modeling work she did in Arlington, Vermont. Rockwell lived in neighboring West Arlington at the time. ""Rosie the Riveter"" is often confused with another popular image from the same era. The poster shows a woman flexing her arm under the slogan ""We Can Do It."" It was part of a nationwide campaign to sell war bonds, but is not the same character. Still, many folks on social media paid tribute to Keefe using the image.

"'Are you smarter than a really smart Singapore high school student? See if you can figure out Cheryl's birthday, the Singapore logic problem that's got the Internet twisted into knots. Some are even saying it's the math equivalent of the ""What color is the dress"" debate. The puzzling problem went viral after Singapore television host Kenneth Kong posted it to Facebook.

Some time passed and she didn't notice any changes in her vision so she neglected to continue the treatment.  What she didn't know at the time was that the disease had progressed to the point where it caused severe damage to her eyes.  A few months ago, she noticed that while driving at night she saw ""ghosts"" in the cars ahead of her.  When she got off the freeway it was difficult to see the lights guiding her to the exit.  She went to the eye doctor who examined her eyes and confirmed her fears - she had severe glaucoma in both eyes.

"'A longtime friend of Joni Mitchell has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer-songwriter's conservator. Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: ""At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs."" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. ""Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital."" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that ""the website"" was accurate.

"'About 20 hours after the Boston Marathon started Monday, many of the cheering crowds had dispersed and the streets were cleared. But one man, despite the odds against him, crossed the finish line. Venezuelan native Maickel Melamed, who is battling muscular dystrophy, completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. Tuesday. A group of energized fans rallied for the 39-year-old as he walked down Boylston Street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, Vamos. He was the last participant to complete the race, CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported. Friends who were waiting for Melamed to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated. ""He wants to show that life is great, no matter how many problems you can have,"" friend Perla Sananes said. Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking. Melamed has completed marathons in Chicago, New York, Berlin and Tokyo. Boston has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby, WCVB-TV said. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line Tuesday morning, and also by fans online. Melamed is one of about 30,000 participants who raced in this year's marathon, which comes less than two weeks after a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 Boston bombings.

""It's been surreal I feel like we're breaking the Internet but in a really great way,"" she told CNN affiliate WPIX.

This isn't the first time rainbows have shown up in multiples. But the splendor of such a scene can render us speechless, even emotional -- much like the star of the famous ""double rainbow"" video.

"'Five militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party were killed and another was wounded in clashes with Turkish armed forces in eastern Turkey, the country's military said Saturday. Four Turkish soldiers also were wounded in the fighting that took place in the eastern city of Agri, the armed forces said in a written statement. The Kurdish separatists opened fire from a long distance, targeting Turkish soldiers who were securing an area in Agri ahead of a spring festival, CNN Turk reported. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the violence and said via Twitter that ""the appropriate answer to the heinous attack in Agri is being given by the Turkish armed forces."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also harshly condemned the attack, describing it as the Kurdish separatists' attempt to ""intervene in the resolution process (with the Kurds) in our country."" Last month, Abdullah Ocalan, longtime leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), called from his jail cell for the violence to end. In a historic letter, he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms, stop their war against the Turkish state and join a ""congress"" to focus on the future. Since the first incidents more than three decades ago, an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost. The conflict has been, some say, a battle by activists among Turkey's Kurdish minority for independence. It has been, others say, a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts. About a fifth of Turkey's population is Kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression, most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of Turkey. From Turkish prison, Kurdish leader tells followers to lay down their arms.' ","##### #####
The above text outlines the beginning of a new chapter between the Kurds in Turkey and the government, as the Kurdish separatist group recently called for an end to the violence. This is significant because it marks the first time that the group has communicated with the Turkish government since the 1980s. The group's message comes at a critical time, as Turkey and the Kurds work toward achieving peace after nearly 40 years of conflict.

In addition to condemning the attacks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan also expressed his desire to work with the Kurds to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. This sentiment was echoed by Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned leader of the PKK, who wrote a historic letter calling for an end to the violence.

The letter is a sign of progress and a hopeful sign for the future of peace in Turkey. However, much work still needs to be done to achieve true peace between the Turks and the Kurds. The two groups must come together and find a way to put aside their differences and work toward a common goal. Only then can they move forward and build a better future for themselves and for the region.

""It's a first draft of the screenplay by John Hughes,"" Wallace said. The manuscript sports the approval signature of the district's then-superintendent and reveals that Molly Ringwald's character, Claire Standish, was originally to be named Cathy Douglas, according to the Tribune. The movie was filmed at the Maine North High School building, which was auctioned off by the district years ago and is now occupied by the Illinois State Police, according to the Tribune.

Wallace told the Tribune that he would like to find a way to display the script as a piece of film -- and district -- history. ""The odds of having such an iconic movie filmed and associated with your district are astronomical,"" he told the newspaper. ""The Breakfast Club"" returns to theaters 30 years later.' ","#####Summary: #####

A recently discovered first draft of the iconic 1985 teenage comedy classic, ""The Breakfast Club"", written by John Hughes, reveals that one of the main characters was originally named differently. It also sheds light on other minor details of the story that were changed during the writing and filming process.

The script, dating back to September 23, 1983, was found in a filing cabinet at Maine Township High School District 207, where some scenes from the movie were shot. The script shows that the protagonist, Claire Standish, was originally named Cathy Douglas, among other changes.

Superintendent Kenneth Wallace revealed that he was surprised when he opened the file and saw the high school's name on it. He intends to exhibit the script as a piece of film history for the district.

""The odds of having such an iconic movie filmed and associated with your district are astronomical,"" Wallace told the Chicago Tribune. ""The Breakfast Club"" will return to theaters this spring, 30 years after its original release, to celebrate its legacy.

"'WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has agreed to be interviewed by Swedish prosecutors in London, his lawyer in Sweden told CNN. Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. According to the lawyer, Thomas Olsson, Swedish prosecutors will now have to reach out to British and Ecuadorian authorities to request permission to conduct the interview at the embassy. The prosecutors previously balked at coming to Britain to question Assange. However, some of the alleged crimes will be subject to a statute of limitations in August 2015, according to a statement from Marianne Ny, the director of public prosecutions. Ny explained the logic behind the Swedish authorities' change of approach in her statement. ""My view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London would lower the quality of the interview, and that he would need to be present in Sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future,"" Ny said. ""This assessment remains unchanged. Now that time is of the essence, I have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward, particularly as there are no other measures on offer without Assange being present in Sweden."" The Australian national has not been charged and denies the claims. Assange has said he fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks. Ecuador granted Assange political asylum in 2012. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.' ","##### #####

Tornadoes touching down near Dallas on Sunday, Ryan Shepard snapped a photo of a black cloud formation reaching down to the ground. He said it was a tornado. It would be an understatement to call it a monster. A mile wide! said Jamie Moore, head of emergency management in Johnson County, Texas. Half a mile wide, said  the local resident, Mr. Moore. It looked more like a tornado than I've ever seen before, said another witness, Gabrielle Ross, who sheltered in her house for 20 minutes.

The twister, which the National Weather Service classified as an EF3 tornado with winds estimated at 170 mph, cut a path approximately 8 miles long by 1 mile wide. Fortunately, it traveled through rural areas, avoiding any human settlements. As a result, there were no reports of casualties. However, inspectors haven't yet been able to assess the damage caused by the storm because of the poor weather conditions.

Alexis Keslar was walking with her twin sons, Silas and Eli Keslar, along a canal Friday when she tried to repel a bee, police in Yuma said. ""The stroller rolled away from her into the canal, with the boys belted in the seat,"" police said Monday. Keslar went into the canal and tried to rescue her sons, authorities said, but was hampered by the steep sides of the canal, the depth of the water and the force of the current. The current washed the stroller away. After Keslar got out of the canal, she called for help, police said. The irrigation district that manages the canal slowed the flow of water and reduced the water level to help emergency workers find the boys, authorities said. After more than an hour of searching, the toddlers were found and flown to a hospital, where they were pronounced dead.

"'Thousands sought refuge in temporary shelters in South Africa after mobs with machetes attacked immigrants in Durban, leaving at least five people dead, an aid group said Thursday. Heavily armed police have scrambled to stop clashes this week after local residents accused immigrants from other African nations of taking their jobs. The attacks in Durban killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. ""There has been an outpouring of support from ordinary South Africans who are disgusted with the attacks not only because they are foreign, or African, but because they are fellow human beings,"" said Gift of the Givers charity, which is helping those seeking refuge. ""We are preparing aid packages for those who may journey onwards to their home countries."" The charity said about 8,500 people fled to refugee centers or police stations this week because of the violence. That doesn't count anyone who fled their homes to other, private accommodations, the group said. It said it hopes the violence is limited to Durban, but assured immigrants that it has a facility in Johannesburg to help those who might need shelter there. ""We have tents and all essential supplies on standby but pray that sanity prevails and this does not become necessary,"" it said. In the past, Johannesburg has been the epicenter of anti-immigrant tensions. In 2008, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. In that attack, police arrested more than 200 people for various crimes including rape, murder, robbery and theft.' ","##### #####

Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012.

"'Like phone booths and typewriters, record stores are a vanishing breed -- another victim of the digital age. Camelot Music. Virgin Megastores. Wherehouse Music. Tower Records. All of them gone. Corporate America has largely abandoned brick-and-mortar music retailing to a scattering of independent stores, many of them in scruffy urban neighborhoods. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Yes, it's harder in the Spotify era to find a place to go buy physical music. But many of the remaining record stores are succeeding -- even thriving -- by catering to a passionate core of customers and collectors. On Saturday, hundreds of music retailers will hold events to commemorate Record Store Day, an annual celebration of, well, your neighborhood record store. Many stores will host live performances, drawings, book signings, special sales of rare or autographed vinyl and other happenings. Some will even serve beer. To their diehard customers, these places are more than mere stores: They are cultural institutions that celebrate music history (the entire Duran Duran oeuvre, all in one place!), display artifacts (Aretha Franklin on vinyl!), and nurture the local music scene (hey, here's a CD by your brother's metal band!). They also employ knowledgeable clerks who will be happy to debate the relative merits of ""Blood on the Tracks"" and ""Blonde on Blonde."" Or maybe, like Jack Black in ""High Fidelity,"" just mock your lousy taste in music. So if you're a music geek, drop by. But you might think twice before asking if they stock ""I Just Called to Say I Love You.""' ","##### SAMPLE RESPONSE

"'Sabra Dipping Co. is recalling 30,000 cases of hummus due to possible contamination with Listeria, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. The nationwide recall is voluntary. So far, no illnesses caused by the hummus have been reported. The potential for contamination was discovered when a routine, random sample collected at a Michigan store on March 30 tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. The FDA issued a list of the products in the recall. Anyone who has purchased any of the items is urged to dispose of or return it to the store for a full refund. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, the FDA says. Although some people may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.'

"'Washington (CNN)A shooting that prompted the lockdown of the U.S. Capitol for several hours Saturday was a suicide and does not have an apparent connection to terrorism, Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said in a news conference. An unidentified male walked through a public area on the west front of the Capitol early Saturday afternoon and shot himself, Dine told reporters. Witnesses told CNN dozens of shocked onlookers watched, including some young children. The unidentified shooter had a backpack and a rolling suitcase that authorities treated as treated suspicious packages, prompting the lockdown as they were investigated, Capitol police said. The male carried a sign with a message about ""social justice,"" authorities said. A witness, Robert Bishop, told CNN it also said something about taxing the ""1%."" Dine said there was ""no nexus to terrorism"" apparent so far in this incident. The building and the nearby Capitol Visitors Center were locked down, meaning tourists or any staff could not enter or leave the buildings. The Capitol area was crowded with tourists taking in the Cherry Blossom trees, which are in full bloom along the National Mall. Members of the Capitol police force, which responded to the scene, did not fire their weapons, Dine said. After the suspicious packages were examined, the lockdown was lifted about 3:50 p.m. ET and pedestrian traffic was allowed. Responding to the incident were the Metropolitan Police Department, which is investigating the death, as well as the FBI, Secret Service and Park Police. Many tourists at the scene were filming at the time and showed their photos and video to investigating law enforcement officers. CNN's Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.'

"'Lane Bryant has come up with a devil of an idea to market its lingerie while poking fun at a competitor. The plus-size clothing retailer has launched an ad campaign for its Cacique line titled #ImNoAngel, seeking to ""redefine sexy."" In a commercial posted on You Tube, a group of plus-size models show off the bras and panties while saying things like ""How boring would it be if we were all the same?"" and ""It's all about how you feel."" The campaign is a not-so-subtle dig at Victoria's Secret and its very popular Angels line, which caters to smaller women. The lingerie giant was criticized last year for a campaign featuring the words ""Perfect Body"" over images of slender supermodels, and Business Insider reports that it is under increasing pressure from consumers to offer larger sizes. Lane Bryant's campaign is getting positive buzz in social media land, with the company being hailed for celebrating beauty of all shapes and sizes.

The Pontiff lamented the suffering of people in the conflicts currently making headlines and called for violence everywhere to end. Foremost, he asked that bloodshed end in Iraq and Syria and that humanitarian aid get to those in need. ""May the international community not stand by before the immense humanitarian tragedy unfolding in these countries and the drama of the numerous refugees,"" he said in his ""urbi et orbi"" address, Latin for ""to the city (Rome) and to the world.""

Francis mentioned Libya; the nuclear talks with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland; Yemen; Nigeria; South Sudan; and the shooting at the Garissa University College in Kenya. He also hoped for peace in Ukraine and for healing for those who have suffered there. The Pope turned to economic oppression: ""We ask for peace and freedom for the many men and women subject to old and new forms of enslavement on the part of criminal individuals and groups,"" he said.

"'Video may have killed the radio star, but in Norway it's digital that's killing FM radio. In two years' time, the Scandinavian nation is slated to become the first in the world to phase out radio entirely. That doesn't mean that Norwegians will be left with radio silence; they'll merely have to tune in digitally. According to officials in Oslo, many in this nation of 5 million have already made the move. On FM, Norwegians can only find five stations. On the Digital Audio Broadcasting network, there are four times that number. Half the country already listens that way, said Culture Minister Thorhild Widvey. ""Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio-content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality,"" Widvey said in a news release. Officials say the move will spur innovation because the cost of digital transmission will save some $25 million. But the country's radio waves won't cut out all once, a blog post on Radio.no explained. Radio will be phased out region by region, starting in January 2017 and concluding in December.' ","#####SOME KEY POINTS###

#####Norway plans to get rid of traditional FM radio transmissions completely by the end of 2016, replacing them with a digital broadcast system. This makes Norway the first country in the world to completely phase out radio.

The plan is to replace FM radio transmissions with a digital broadcast system called DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting). The switch will happen in three steps, with one station going offline per month from October 2015 until December 2016. After this, radio will officially no longer be available on FM frequencies. Instead, people will need to listen to radio using a digital receiver or through online streaming services.

The decision to switch off FM radio was taken back in 2012, when the previous centre-right government announced its plan to shut down FM radio by the year 2020. However, due to public opposition, the shutdown was delayed until 2022. The current centre-left coalition government has since moved forward with the original plan and has begun shutting down FM radio signals.

The main argument for switching to digital radio is financial. Norway spends millions of kroner every year to broadcast national and local radio on FM frequencies, an expensive process that requires continuous funding. By contrast, digital radio transmissions require far less resources to maintain"," Norway plans to eliminate traditional FM radio transmissions by the end of 2016, making it the first country to completely phase out radio. | False |

"'A Detroit mother arrested last month after police discovered the bodies of two of her children inside a freezer was arraigned this week on murder and torture charges. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy charged Mitchelle Angela Blair on Wednesday with killing her then 13-year-old daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, and her then 9-year-old son, Stephen Gage Berry. According to Detroit Police Chief James Craig, the bodies were found wrapped in plastic inside the freezer by a bailiff performing a court ordered eviction on March 24. The Wayne County medical examiner has since determined that Stoni died from multiple blunt trauma injuries and Stephen from multiple blunt trauma and thermal injuries. Both were determined to be homicides, according to spokesman Ryan Bridges. According to CNN affiliate WDIV,  investigators believe Stephen was scalded with hot water, beaten and strangled in August 2012, while Stoni was killed in May 2013. A message left for Blair's court appointed attorney, who entered not guilty pleas on her behalf at her arraignment, wasn't immediately returned. In addition to the two counts of premeditated murder -- each of which carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole --  Blair, 35, has been charged with two counts of torture, four counts of felony child abuse and one count of committing child abuse in the presence of another child. She has two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, both of whom are now in in protective custody, according to Worthy. Blair will be back in court June 19 for a court ordered competency hearing.' ","##### #####

"'""It's showtime!"" Michael Keaton paid homage -- ever so slightly -- to his roles in ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Batman"" in his third turn hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" this weekend. Keaton acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982. ""I had a baby -- he's 31. I also have a new girlfriend -- she's 28,"" he said. Fans who were hoping for a full-blown revival of Keaton's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed. SNL cast members Taran Killam and Bobby Moynihan begged the actor with a song to ""play"" Batman and Beetlejuice with them. All they got in response were a couple of one-liners. Overall, Keaton's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its ""deadpan"" manner and ""unpredictable weirdness,"" in the words of A.V. Club's Dennis Perkins. Fans also delighted in a cameo from ""Walking Dead"" star Norman Reedus during Weekend Update. Keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who's not very good at his job, a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy ""She's All That."" Other crowd-pleasing spots included a Scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the NCAA student-athlete debate. The show also poked fun at CNN with cast member Cecily Strong playing anchor Brooke Baldwin. Baldwin said on Twitter that she's taking it as a ""crazy compliment"" and shared a clip from the skit.'

"'Johannesburg (CNN)South African troops deployed Tuesday evening as part of a new government effort to stop deadly anti-immigrant violence. Their first target: the Johannesburg suburb of Jeppestown, where xenophobic violence broke out on Friday. South African police raided a Jeppestown hostel Tuesday while troops secured the perimeter. Earlier, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula announced the plan to deploy an undisclosed number of troops to areas where police are spread too thin while trying to curb deadly attacks against immigrants. ""This intervention is not an indictment on the police. ... We are coming in because they need that support,"" she said after visiting Johannesburg's Alexandra township, one area where mobs have attacked immigrants from other African nations and looted their shops -- ostensibly based on the belief that immigrants are taking South Africans' jobs. Seven people have been killed in recent violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors. Xenophobic killing caught by photographer. Much of this month's violence happened in the port city of Durban, where at least two foreigners and three South Africans were killed after mobs with machetes attacked immigrant shops. Thousands of people took temporary shelter at refugee centers or police stations as a result, according to aid group Gift of the Givers. Similar violence happened late last week in Johannesburg, where immigrant-owned shops were looted or destroyed. The attacks came as residents accused immigrants of taking their jobs and committing crimes. The unemployment rate in South Africa is 25%, according to government figures. The United Nations said the attacks began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. What's behind the xenophobic attacks in South Africa?

The Palestinian cause gained significant international attention during the 1960s with the rise of Palestinian nationalism1. In 1965, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), made up of all Muslim countries, issued a landmark resolution recognising thePalestinian people's right to their own homeland2. This was followed by the 1967 Six Day War between Israel and several Arab states. At this time, the OIC once again called for the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination3.

In 1979, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) formally recognised Israel's right to exist in peace4. However, this recognition was conditional on Israel returning to its pre-1967 borders5. The PLO also called for the liberation of Palestinian land, the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes and the establishment of a Palestinian state6.

In 1988, the Palestinian National Council declared the creation of an independent State of Palestine7. This declaration was largely symbolic, as it had no practical implications8. Nevertheless, it marked a significant step towards Palestinian statehood9.

"'The ""Star Wars"" universe keeps on expanding. Details of the plot for 2016's ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" were revealed during a panel at Star Wars Celebration fan festival Sunday in Anaheim, California. Director Gareth Edwards (""Godzilla"") showed an early teaser for the movie and revealed plot details for the ""Star Wars"" anthology film (the term Disney prefers instead of ""spinoff""), starring Felicity Jones. The movie will take place in between ""Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" and ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" (known to many as the first ""Star Wars"" movie from 1977). A group of rebels go on a rogue mission to steal plans for the Death Star. Jones will play a rebel soldier. The movie won't begin shooting until this summer so the footage shown in the teaser -- including a glimpse of the Death Star -- won't necessarily appear in the finished product. Edwards told the crowd that Jones is a ""Star Wars"" fan and dropped everything to take on the lead role. Producer Kathleen Kennedy said ""Rogue One"" was one of the first pitches she received after becoming president of Lucasfilm in 2012, and she could not turn it down. It was one of the final events at Celebration, where fans gather to talk about ""Star Wars,"" dress in costumes, look for rare ""Star Wars"" merchandise and learn about future projects for the franchise. The convention kicked off with the well-received trailer for this year's ""The Force Awakens."" Costumes and props from that movie also were on display. Anything bearing the movie logo was a hot item for collectors. Tens of thousands are expected to have attended the event when all is said and done.

"'Andros Townsend enjoyed silencing the critics with his wonder strike for England, saying naysayers like Paul Merson provided the perfect motivation for him in Italy. This has been a topsy-turvy season for the 23-year-old, who has yet to reach the heights he scaled when he first burst onto the international scene.

The Aral Sea was one of the largest lakes in the world. It was located between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and covered an area of 26,000 km2 (10,000 sq mi). It was fed by two major rivers, the Ural and the Amudarya, which came from mountain glaciers in Central Asia.

The name ""Aral"" comes from the word aral, which means swamp or marsh in several Turkic languages. This is probably because this region was covered with swamps and mudflats before the construction of the water transfer systems.

The sea was first documented by the Russian explorer Yermak in 1552. In the 18th century, the area was included in the Khanate of Crimea. In the 19th century, it became part of the Tsardom of Russia. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the sea was split between the newly formed Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), which later dissolved into the modern countries of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

In the early 20th century, the size of the sea was about 25,500 km2 (9,900 sq mi). However, the water flow was reduced by"," The Aral Sea was one of the largest lakes in the world, covering an area of 26,000 km2 (10,000 sq mi). | False |

"'Scoring against your old team, and executing a perfect set-piece from the training ground are two of the most satisfying things in football. For Notts County star Ellen White, Thursday night was a night to remember as she managed both at the same time against Arsenal in the Women's Super League. In the 26th minute, with County having been awarded a free kick on the edge of the box, Laura Bassett and Alex Greenwood appeared to mess things up, the former almost running into the latter. Laura Bassett and Alex Greenwood almost run into each other, causing confusion at the free kick. Ellen White spins on the edge of the box and fires the free kick into the corner against her former club. As the Arsenal defence relaxed, the ball was shifted for White, who span and smashed it into the corner against the club where she spent three seasons. 'Thankfully it came off,' White told BBC Radio Nottingham. 'But now we can never do it again, which is a little annoying.' 'We have been working on things a little bit differently in pre-season. I'm pleased it went in because I've skied it over the bar and it has gone wide, but thankfully that one went in.' However, White also missed a penalty which would have made it 2-0, before Arsenal hit back to equalise late on and rescue a point. Arsenal equalised five minutes from time when Chioma Ubogagu netted a debut goal to earn a point.' ","#####

"'Get ready to dig deep - the impulse to buy a treat peaks today at 12.52pm. A study claims that Britons spend an average of £62 a week on rewarding themselves, with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today. Treats can range from as little as a bar of chocolate or a glass of wine to designer clothes and shoes, according to research by website VoucherCodes.co.uk. A study reveals that Britons spend an average of £62 a week on rewarding themselves, with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today. Treats can range from a bar of chocolate to a glass of wine. And surprisingly, men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves. They are also more likely to lie about their expenditure and hide items they have purchased from their partners in a desperate quest to keep their shopping habits under wraps, a different survey last year found. The shoppers of Swansea are the most frivolous, with 44 per cent splurging as soon as they are paid, followed by those in Aberdeen (42 per cent) and Belfast (39 per cent). The most cautious spenders live in Wolverhampton, where only 19 per cent choose to treat themselves on pay day. Designer items (stock image above) are also popular buys and men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves, the research claims. Other research claimed the average Brit spends £153 within 24 hours of payday - while 10 per cent splurge more than £500. Some workers said they spend so much in the 24 hours after payday because they had arranged their regular payments and direct debits to leave their accounts around that time. While others said it was because they felt like they deserved the treat.' ","##### Human: ##### Okay, thank you for the detailed explanation!

The driver  sprays his car with insect repellent, forcing a huntsman spider to reveal itself from under the door handle. ‘Get out, you bast***,’ he stoically says to the spider. But the man appears less composed when the hairy huntsman’s legs pop out, yelping and cowering back in fright. ‘That’s the creepiest thing ever,’ he says between yelling expletives. ‘It’s a bloody super-spider!’ Having endured  enough of the spray, the spider drops onto road and retreats underneath the vehicle.

"'A seven-year-old boy was raped and set on fire by two youths when he went to buy some food. The youths took the boy to an isolated place and raped him. When he resisted, they set him on fire, Inspector Sasthe told PTI. The boy, who suffered 30 per cent burns to his body, somehow managed to escape, Sasthe added. The shocking incident occurred in Pagma Nagar (located on this map), in Bhiwandi City, a suburb of Mumbai. The incident, which happened in Bhiwandi, in Mumbai (stock image) is being investigated by police. The incident took place in Padma Nagar in the city of Bhiwandi, a suburb of Mumbai, police said today. A case has been registered under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 377 (sodomy) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012. The seven-year-old boy is being treated at the Thane Civil hospital, about 30 minutes away. Police have said they are working to identify and catch the accused.' ","##### Summary

A seven year old boy went to buy some food but was instead kidnapped, abused, and eventually killed by his abductors. His badly injured body was found several hundred meters from the initial location, set on fire.

The horrific attack appears to have been motivated by the victim's refusal to submit to his assailants' sexual demands.

The suspects, responsible for this atrocity, are still at large, and the police are actively searching for them.

Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the perpetrators is urged to contact the authorities immediately.

"'Most fans wants to get their hands on a rare piece of memorabilia once belonging to their favourite player or team and little bits of history can fetch thousands of pounds on the open market. But you may be surprised to know that an expired passport of Paul Parker - most famous for playing right back for Manchester United and England during the nineties - was listed on eBay for an eye-watering £5,000. The item was listed earlier in March and bidding ended on Tuesday but it is unclear whether anyone actually stumped up the sizeable sum being quoted. Ex-Manchester United and England defender Paul Parker's old passport was listed on eBay. The former defender's expired passport was listed for £5,000 but the seller was open to offers. 'This listing was ended by the seller because the item is no longer available,' read the message on eBay. Although the old passport was listed for £5,000, the seller made it clear he was open to negotiation, asking potential buyers to 'make me an offer and see if I accept'. Parker (right) played for Manchester United between 1991 and 1996 and won two league titles at Old Trafford. Parker closes down Holland forward Marco van Basten during one of his 19 caps for England. The eBay seller described Parker, 50, as an 'ex-Manchester United and Chelsea legend' but, while he made more than 100 appearances for United and won two league titles, his grand total of four outings for the Blues doesn't quite merit legendary status. Parker made 19 international appearances but his United and England career ended largely because of the emergence of Gary Neville.' ","##### ebay

"'Villagers from Shandong Province in eastern China have reportedly resorted to transporting natural gas in plastic bags. Recent images show intrepid residents from Lijin village in Dongying city carry the explosive in bags as long as six metres on rickshaws, reported the People’s Daily Online. Worried passers-by compared this behaviour to carrying a bomb on their backs because any contact with a naked flame or even a cigarette could spell disaster. Gas-guzzler: Carrying natural gas in huge plastic bags is a common scene in some villages in Shandong. Penny-pinching: Local media suggest this is a way for villages to save money on the transportation of gas. This reckless behaviour has been reported on as early as May 2011 in Zibo city in Shandong. It has since spread to different parts of the province. Netizens and media suggest this is a way for the locals to save money on transportation. Some suggest they are actually stealing gas. An earlier undercover investigation by Anhui Satellite TV Station shows that villagers in Zibo have little understanding of the dangers, claiming it to be safe. Unaware of danger: Previous investigation discovered that residents had little understanding of the hazards. The news clip documented villagers and even school pupils stealing gas from a large roadside container. Their plastic bags were inflated within minutes, and they carried them off before someone else came along to do the same. Villagers told the undercover reporter transporting gas this way isn't dangerous at all. Questions are now being raised within China about why the authorities have taken no steps to ban this practise after all these years. Unprotected: The gas bags are sealed in a basic manner. Passers-by worry they could spell disaster any time.' ","###Summary:

"'Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew insists Manchester City can come from behind again to snatch the Barclays Premier League title from Chelsea. City overtook Liverpool with one match to go before being crowned champions last season and in 2012, Sergio Aguero's injury-time strike in the final game sank Manchester United on goal difference. Chelsea are currently six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand but Pardew, whose Palace side host City on Monday, believes the race is far from over. Alan Pardew cups his ears during a clash between Crystal Palace against Stoke and the Eagles boss has refused to rule Manchester City out of the title race. Manchester City won the Premier League title last season after going top with one game to play. Sergio Aguero's dramatic injury time winner against QPR in 2012 sealed City's first Premier League title win.

"'Brazil's World Cup stadium in Natal is up for sale as the company that owns it is suffering from cash flow problems following a corruption scandal. Natal's Dunas Arena is being sold by owner Grupo OAS, with the company also trying to sell the 50 percent share it owns of the Fonte Nova arena in Salvador. The company has struggled for months with the impact of a corruption investigation at state-controlled oil company Petrobras, which undercut the builder's access to financing. A general view of Natal's Dunas Arena during the World Cup match between Italy and Uruguay last year. An economic downturn, government austerity and a slumping currency has also taken its toll, leading to Grupo OAS to announce it is selling its stakes in the stadiums and other businesses to focus on the core construction business. OAS spent 591 million reais (around £126 million) on completely rebuilding the old Fonte Nova arena in Salvador and 423 million reais (£90 million) on the new Dunas area. The Fonte Nova hosted six games in the 2014 tournament and the Dunas Arena four. The announcement was the latest in a string of bad news for Brazilian football post-World Cup. Holland take on Costa Rica in a World Cup quarter-final at Salvador's Fonte Nova arena last July. Earlier this week Esporte Club Bahia, one of the biggest clubs in Salvador, said they were abandoning plans to use the Fonte Nova because they felt the owners did not respect their fans. Several other stadiums have seen bigger crowds for concerts and religious events than for football and the ground in Cuiaba was closed because of structural problems.' ","##### Sure #####

"'That really takes the biscuit! Celtic's Leigh Griffiths invoked the power of the Tunnock's Tea Cake in his warm-up routine for Good Friday night's game with St Mirren. The controversial striker warily looked round in the dug-out before unwrapping the tasty treat within the first 10 minutes of the vital SPL encounter. His manager, Ronnie Deila has encouraged the concept of the 24/7 athlete by insisting on a strict diet regime for his players. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths was caught on camera enjoying a biscuit during their match at St Mirren. Griffiths was caught in the act on the substitutes bench during the opening 10 minutes of the match. But he wouldn't have been impressed when Griffiths was caught tucking into the biscuit on live TV. Needless to say the Scotland star remained firmly on the bench throughout the Premiership leaders' 2-0 win in Paisley. The commentator on BT Sport asked: 'Are you allowed to do that on the bench? – I'm not sure. Part of a footballer's healthy diet.' Griffiths has always something in reserve.

Disruption: Tens of thousands of teachers could strike in the autumn, potentially causing temporary school closures. Members will be asked to consider funding shortages in schools, which the union said would lead to redundancies.

Last month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested schools could see cuts of up to 12 per cent over the next parliament.' ","#####

The video, inspired by action films, shows the two literally saving 'the date' as they wash up on shore, fight friends disguised as villains and ultimately escape from one very large explosion.

The club's official English Twitter account confirmed that Luiz had suffered a muscle pull, tweeting: ""@DavidLuiz_4 crumples to the ground with a hamstring pull #OMPSG.""

Reports suggest the 27-year-old could be sidelined for several weeks, which could see him miss important matches against Sochaux, Bastia, Lyon, Real Madrid and Barcelona, whom PSG face in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on April 15.

When the first egg emerges she cries  for joy and when the third comes she lets out a shriek with her arms waving around.

The footage shows the two-metre long reptile managing to balance at the top of the pole while swallowing its prey. The lizard swings its neck back and forth as it battles to swallow its catch, before managing to finish the feat in under a minute. Scroll down for video. The grisly footage shows the ravenous reptile battling to swallow its ill-fated prey. The video begins by closing in on the top of a towering power pole, where the goanna is perched with the rabbit. Prominent in Aboriginal mythology, goannas can unhinge their lower jaws when feeding, allowing them to eat over-sized prey. They are  not picky with their choice of food either, consuming anything from insects to birds and eggs through to large mammals like possums and cats. They even eat dead and rotten animals, and are attracted to the smell of rotten meat. The video, uploaded to YouTube last week, begins with the message: ‘Goanna swallows rabbit, some people may find this video a bit disturbing, but it’s only nature.’ Goannas, which come from the monitor lizard family, are found throughout most of Australia, but it’s unknown where the clip was filmed. The lizard swings its neck back and forth as it battles to swallow the catch, before managing to finish the feat in under a minute. Goannas can unhinge their lower jaws when feeding, allowing them to dispose of some staggering sized prey including the likes of possums and cats.

The 2018 Masters Tournament was the 80th edition of the Masters Tournament and the first of golf's four major championships in 2018.[1] Played between April 5 and April 9, it was held at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia,[2][3] which has hosted the tournament 75 times since 1934.[4]

In a change to previous years, 78 players were eligible for the official money list instead of the usual 60. The increase was to include the top 45 finishers in the Official World Golf Ranking within the field, along with former champions and major winners from the past five years.[5]

American Patrick Reed secured his first major championship, two strokes ahead of Sergio García of Spain, who ended a drought of more than 10 years since his last major finish. An eagle on the final hole helped Reed hold off a late charge from García, who birdied the final two holes after bogeys on 14 and 16. American Brooks Koepka became the first player to hold back-to-back titles since Hal Sutton in 1983. He won by one stroke over England's Tommy Fleetwood.

Federer, who turned 33 years old last month, has been known for his love and passion for tennis. However, in recent years, he has been more cautious about his health and fitness, which is why he took a break from the Miami Open, even though it is one of his favorite tournaments. In the interview, Federer's agent, Tony Godsick, explained that the tennis star takes her fitness very seriously and she needs to make sure that she can maintain it for many years to come.

In addition to his professional achievements, Federer is also known for his charitable work. He has set up the Roger Federer Foundation, which focuses on providing education and opportunities for underprivileged children in southern Africa.

"'Ludogorets player Cosmin Moti is guilty of producing one of the worst tackles you're likely to see this season after his kung-fu style tackle on a CSKA Sofia player - but unbelievably the referee waved play on. It was a kick Eric Cantona would have been proud of, as he connected cleanly with Stefan Nikolic's rib-cage and sending his opponent crashing to the floor. The defender made the headlines for the right reasons during Ludogorets Champions League play-off against Steaua Bucharest back in August, when he saved two penalties during the shoot-out - after their goalkeeper had been sent off. Cosmin Moti (centre right) kung-fu tacklesStefan Nikolic during Ludogorets clash with CSKA Sofia. His heroics sent the Bulgarian side through to the Champions League group stages as he established himself as a club legend. But Moti's kick on Nikolic shows a different side and the misdemeanor during the first half went unpunished as his side went on to win the contest 4-0 - sending them six points clear of their rivals at the top. It could have been so different for the away side if he had been given his marching orders but due to some shocking refereeing, that wasn't the case. The defender leaps up and aims his right foot at the forward but wasn't sent off for the tackle. Moti connects cleanly Nikolic's rib cage but the referee waved play on - much to the disgust of CSKA. The forward screams in pain after the horrific tackle and lands heavily on the Ludogorets pitch. Moti celebrates his first penalty save against Steaua Bucharest during their UEFA Champions League play off.' ","#####
The text discusses the incident of a football player, Cosmin Moti, who committed a dangerous and violent foul while playing against another team, CSKA Sofia. Moti used an illegal and reckless challenge to tackle the opposing team's striker, Stefan Nikolic, outside the box. The tackle involved kicking Nikolic in the torso, which is a clear foul according to the Laws of the Game. However, the referee did not punish Moti directly, and the match continued.

The news article goes on to describe how this incident made national headlines in Bulgaria due to the severity of the foul and the fact that Moti is a fan favorite. Additionally, it highlights the irony of the situation, as Moti is known for his defensive skills and commitment, yet he committed a foul that denied his own team a clear opportunity to score a goal.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of fair and consistent officiating in sports. Without proper punishment for fouls and misconduct, the integrity of the game is threatened and players may feel less responsibility to abide by the rules. Ultimately, the outcome of the match between CSKA Sofia and Ludogorets depended on the actions of the referee, who failed to uphold the standards of fairness and safety expected in"," Football player Cosmin Moti committed a dangerous and violent foul during a match against CSKA Sofia. | True |

"'Brian O'Driscoll won't be thanking whoever snapped him crowd surfing at a party in Hong Kong any time soon after the picture went viral. To make matters worse the Irish rugby legend's wife Amy Huberman caught wind of the picture on social media, with hilarious consequences. O'Driscoll has been in Hong Kong this week working as an ambassador for HSBC ahead of the Hong Kong Sevens and clearly found time to unwind away from his commitments. Amy Huberman shares a joke with her husband in the Royal Box at Wimbledon last summer. The couple are pictured attending a Downing Street reception following the victorious 2013 Lions tour. On Monday, at home in Ireland, actress Huberman posted the picture of O'Driscoll and wrote: 'You know when your husband is away in Hong Kong on a very important business trip...' This was followed by a that read: 'I better get a giant Toblerone from the duty free.' Sure enough, O'Driscoll returned on Tuesday, tail between his legs with the requested Toblerone. Clearly taking some joy in her husband's embarrassment, Huberman later posted a picture of O'Driscoll holding the chocolate bar, declaring: 'He's home.' O'Driscoll may think twice before crowd surfing in future. The couple celebrates Ireland's Six Nations success in O'Driscoll's final international match in March 2014.' ","#####SOME IMPORTANT POINTS TO CONSIDER WHILE CROWD SURFING
while there are many enjoyable aspects of crowd-sports or live entertainment, it is always important to keep safety first. #####General Tips While Crowd Surfing 1. Make sure you can fit through the crowd - sometimes, the wave will squeeze you into a tight space where you'll have to contort yourself to avoid bumping into anyone or anything. Make sure you can easily slip through such spaces. 2. Look out for sharp objects - leather straps, metal buckles, glass/stone surfaces; anything could potentially hurt if they dig into your skin. 3. Don't panic - lose your breath but don't show it. Relax your body. 4. Don't try to stop the flow - let the crowd push and pull you around like a cork. 5. Strike a balance between standing too still and moving too much - maintain a steady position in the crowd so that you don't get swept away with the current, but don't stand rigidly still either, as this might cause you to get stuck at the front of the crowd. 6. Be prepared for unexpected occurrences - sudden drops, sharp turns, congestion caused by other surfers in"," Crowd surfing can be an enjoyable aspect of live entertainment. | True |

"'Mauricio Pochettino wants talks with the FA before approving Harry Kane’s involvement in the forthcoming European Under 21 Championship. Sportsmail understands Tottenham have major concerns about the striker playing in the summer — and will convey those views to Wembley chiefs. England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed this week that Kane will be available for the competition in the Czech Republic, despite playing for the seniors in recent clashes against Lithuania and Italy. Harry Kane celebrates after opening his account against Lithuania in his England senior debut. Kane could find himself at the centre of a club vs country row ahead of the U21 European Championships. But Spurs fear Kane may suffer burnout and see him as key to the club’s PR strategy ahead of their post-season tour of Australia and Malaysia. Pochettino, who confirmed Hugo Lloris will miss tomorrow’s clash against Burnley with a gashed knee, said: ‘Can he play for the Under 21s? Why not? But Harry Kane is our player and if I decide he is in the squad to go to Sydney, it is our decision. ‘There is a lot of things to discuss with the FA, with Gareth Southgate, with us, but always we try to find the best for the player, and for the national team and what is logical for Tottenham.’ Mauricio Pochettino wants to meet with the FA before making any decision on Kane's availability. Kane, pictured in action against Leicester in March, has been hugely impressive for Tottenham this season.' ","##### Sure #####

Ferguson enjoyed a trophy-laden 26-and-a-half years in the Manchester United hotseat between 1986-2013.

'And I had to realign myself when I got in to my 60s in terms of putting it in and the sleep I needed to maintain my energy until the very end because people expect to see the same enegy all the time.

"'French giants Paris Saint-Germain have been dealt a major blow with the news that David Luiz will miss the Champions League clash with Barcelona. The former Chelsea man pulled up clutching his hamstring following a bursting run against Andre-Pier Gignac in the first-half of Sunday’s game against rivals Marseille. Current French champions PSG went on to win the game but the news of Luiz’ injury came as a major worry. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury. The Brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced. And those worries have since been confirmed as scans revealed the Brazilian will be out of action for at least four weeks meaning he will miss both legs of the quarter-final tie with Barcelona. Laurent Blanc’s side are still fighting for the Ligue One title and could be forced to play eight matches without the 27-year-old.

"'Neil Phillips, the team doctor for England's victorious 1966 World Cup campaign, has died at the age of 83. Manager Sir Alf Ramsey promoted Phillips from his role as Under-23 team doctor just before the '66 World Cup as seniors doctor Alan Bass had run out of holiday and could not join up with the squad for their preparation camp in Lilleshall. Phillips, who was born in Tredegar in south Wales, was England's team doctor for the defence of the Jules Rimet trophy four years later in Mexico and left the FA in 1974 following Ramsey's departure. Dr Neil Phillips (right), pictured with Sir Alf Ramsey (centre) was England's doctor at the 1966 World Cup. Phillips was a former director at Middlesbrough and also used to have a surgery in Redcar. A service of thanksgiving will take place on Wednesday April 8 in Dr Phillips' home town of Malvern in Worcestershire. The FA said: 'Our thoughts are with Neil's family and friends at this sad time.' Phillips was also with England in 1974, alongside Kevin Keegan (centre) and Mick Channon.' ","#####

This message contains a brief summary of the text. It describes how Dr. Neil Phillips, who was the team doctor for England's successful effort to win the World Cup in 1966, passed away at the age of 83. He served as the team doctor for England in the defense of their title in 1970, as well as in 1974.

Phillips was originally hired by the Football Association as an under-23s doctor just prior to the 1966 World Cup, where he worked closely with manager Sir Alf Ramsey. Due to vacation time taken by senior doctor Alan Bass, Phillips was given temporary duty during the preparations for the tournament in Lilleshall.

Despite being based in Teesside as a visiting physician at Middlesbrough Football Club at the time, Phillips ended up serving as the personal doctor to several members of the England squad, including striker Geoff Hurst. Following the team's victory in Mexico, he continued in his role as the doctor for the national side until 1974, working alongside players such as George Cohen, Martin Peters, and Ray Wilson.

The dog crosses the street and heads into a field. The boy continues to follow, crawling on all fours. The man tries to convince the boy to get on all fours like him, but the kid refuses. The man continues to follow the dog, while the other man films them from his car.
They reach the other side of the street, and the man finds himself in a thicket of tall grass. The dog stops, seeming to realize that its companion has disappeared. The man emerges from the tall grass, unscathed. The dog continues on, eventually coming to a stop next to a large mound of dirt.
The man climbs the mound, and discovers a hidden cave. Inside the cave, are piles upon piles of gold coins. The man counts the coins, then packs them into bags. He pulls out a map and points to a nearby town."," A dog is dragging a child behind him as if he were pulling a sled. | True |

"'Blackburn Rovers boss Gary Bowyer has challenged star striker Jordan Rhodes to become an FA Cup hero as the Championship underdogs face Liverpool in the first full house at Ewood Park since 2011. Rovers rejected a £12million bid from Hull City for Scotland international Rhodes at the start of the season — a decision that will be vindicated should the 17-goal striker score the winner in Wednesday night's sixth-round replay and take his side to Wembley. ‘Someone has got to be the hero for Blackburn Rovers,’ said Bowyer. ‘We will need heroes in terms of defending and work-rate, but we also need a match-winner and there is probably no-one better than Jordan Rhodes. Hopefully he can step up and have his name in lights.’ Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer has said Jordan Rhodes (centre) can become an Ewood Park hero. Rhodes goes into the FA Cup replay on the back of scoring in Blackburn's 3-0 win over Leeds. Rovers were a laughing stock when they were last in the FA Cup quarter-finals in 2013 and only 8,000 turned up at Ewood Park to see them lose to Millwall, but Bowyer said: ‘There will be an extra 20,000 people in the stadium compared to that game against Millwall. 'I think it’s recognition from the supporters who have realised the amount of hard work that’s gone into what we’re trying to do, myself and the staff.’ Blackburn’s run is even more impressive because of a restricted squad of 24 players due to breaching Financial Fair Play rules. They also have injuries to Josh King, Chris Taylor, Rudy Gestede and Grant Hanley. Rovers boss Bowyer believes his side will be buoyed by the 'extra 20,000 people' at Ewood Park.' ","#####

Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer challenged star striker Jordan Rhodes to become an FA Cup hero as the Championship underdogs faced Liverpool in a packed out Ewood Park replay on Wednesday.
Rovers rejected a £12m offer from Hull City for Scotland international Rhodes at the start of the season, which turned out to be a decision that will be vindicated should the 17-goal man score the winner in the sixth round replay and take Rovers to Wembley.
""Someone has to be the hero for Blackburn Rovers,"" said Bowyer. ""We will need heroes to defend and work rate, but we also need a match-winner - and there is probably no one better than Jordan Rhodes.

"'Zlatan Ibrahimovic would have been idolised at the Stade Velodrome if he had followed in the same footsteps at Eric Cantona, according to former Marseille boss Jose Anigo. The Paris Saint-Germain forward has been compared with Cantona for the second time in the space of a few days following Peter Schmeichel's comments regarding the 33-year-old. Schmeichel urged Manchester United to make a summer move for Ibrahimovic as he believes the Sweden international has the 'personality' required to become an Old Trafford great in the same vein as Cantona and David Beckham. Zlatan Ibrahimovic would have been idolised at Marseille, according to the club's former manager Jose Anigo. Sweden captain Ibrahimovic scored in Sweden's 3-1 international friendly win over Iran on Tuesday night. Ibrahimovic made an audacious attempt to score a bicycle kick during Sweden's midweek victory. And now Anigo, who managed at the Stade Velodrome on a permanent basis between 2001 and 2005, has said he would have taken great satisfaction from seeing Ibrahimovic at Marseille. 'Everyone heckles him, but Marseille fans would have loved if he had played with OM,' Anigo told Le 10 Sport. 'He reminds me of Cantona.' Cantona played at Marseille between 1988 and 1991 before eventually joining Leeds United after a short spell at Nimes. Eric Cantona plied his trade at Marseille before going on to join Manchester United in November 1992. Peter Schmeichel believes Man United should make a move for Ibrahimovic because he is similar to Cantona. Anigo (right, pictured with Fabien Barthez in 2004) has lavished praise on PSG striker Ibrahimovic.' ","#####

In the video, you can see the raccoon's arms and legs tightly wrapped around the flagpole as it struggles to keep its balance in the wind.

It's unclear how the raccoon got onto the flagpole, but it's believed that the roof of the cathedral is closed at night, so the animal may have climbed up to access the building's gutters.

After a few hours, animal control officers were able to coax the raccoon down from the flagpole. They used blankets and sheets to create a trapeze-like device that they hung from the flagpole using a rope.

Skeptical Chelsea supporters who wish to purchase the kit without Bale's name on the back may also want to avoid getting one with a mention of Didier Drogba.

The weaver ant is one of the most powerful insects in the world because they have unique techniques that help them control their prey. This ant can immobilize its prey by using a technique called ""weaving."" By balancing the prey on its back, the ant can control the movement of the prey and make it unable to move freely. The ant then uses its mouthparts to feed on the sweet liquid inside the prey's body. This process is called trophallaxis.

Disgusting: Mould was seen growing in the tomato puree during an inspection of the takeaway in Gillingham. They included a lack of cleaning, having an uncontrolled mice infestation and selling unfit food. He also admitted two health and safety charges including a failure to maintain the electrical installation to prevent danger. He was fined £14,500 and ordered to pay £2,793 in costs. The court heard officers from Medway Council immediately closed the premises in Gillingham, Kent in January 2014 as they feared an immediate risk to public health. The takeaway reopened several months later and further checks were carried out by the council to ensure the infestation was under control. But it was closed down in May for good by the owner. Infestation: Mouse droppings could be seen all over the floor at the now closed Pizza Plus Fried Chicken. Filthy: A pizza box set to be given to customers sits on top of a horrendously dirty extension cable.

CONCRETE CASTLE
#####
######
The concrete castle (Spanish: castillo en concreto) is a type of construction developed in Uruguay and Argentina in the mid-20th century, whose purpose was to provide a standard design for low-cost housing.
It consists of two or three floors plus an attic space, with a total floor area of approximately 50 to 80 square meters (540 to 840 sq ft). The first level of the building is partially underground, to allow for parking spaces on its upper levels.[1]
The construction system uses reinforced concrete slabs supported on pillars made of poured concrete, instead of the traditional load-bearing walls. This system allows the castle to have a large windowed corner facing the street, providing natural lighting to the majority of the living space. To provide fire protection, the concrete castles use special brick veneer panels.[2]
These buildings are characterized by their simple geometric shapes and their industrial construction system. They are also photovoltaic powered.[3]

"'Mario Balotelli moved a step closer to an Anfield exit in the summer as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed that the Italian had withdrawn himself from the squad to travel to Arsenal after taking a ‘slight knock’ in training. The £16million striker would only have been a substitute against Arsenal and would even have been behind Daniel Sturridge, who also started on the bench, in the pecking order. And Rodgers revealed the striker did not travel with the squad after a sustaining training ground injury on Friday. Mario Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal after picking up a slight knock. Brendan Rodgers revealed that Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad and did not travel to London. ‘He trained on Friday afternoon with the team and he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed himself not able to travel,’ said Rodgers. ‘I’m not a medic. He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it. It was just something that he himself didn’t feel comfortable enough to travel.’ Arsenal ran out 4-1 winners against Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday. Mesut Ozil scored Arsenal's second as Hector Bellerin, Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud also netted. Though Rodgers did not question Balotelli’s commitment to the club’s cause, the player has been a constant source of frustration at the club this season, with the manager having previously made it clear that he would have to work much harder to adapt to Liverpool’s style. With just four goals in 25 appearances, his future at the club is already in question – though he has another three years on his contract.'

"'Some tour guides will do anything for a good tip.

England and Lions flanker Tom Croft has received a major boost in his bid to prove his fitness ahead of this year's Rugby World Cup after signing a new deal with Leicester.
The 29-year-old, who can play both sides of the pitch, has been beset by injuries in recent seasons, having also seen his international career hit lengthy stumbling blocks.
After overcoming a serious neck problem during the 2011 season, Croft managed just one appearance during the 2014 campaign before rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during training prior to the 2017 season.
However, after returning from that setback in June, he featured 10 times off the bench during the 2018 Guinness Premiership and European Champions Cup campaigns before dislocating his shoulder against Newcastle in April.
Following surgery, the former Bath star looked to be in danger of losing his place in the Leicester side but, despite managing just two appearances in the current campaign, he has now penned a fresh contract that runs until 2021.

The Portuguese was booked after being brought down by Rayo defender Antonio Amaya inside the box, incurring a one-game suspension in the process. But Ronaldo is now free to start at the Bernabeu after La Liga's appeals committee decided that he had been unfairly punished at the Estadio de Vallecas. Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to be unfairly cautioned after he was chopped down by Antonio Amaya. The Real Madrid star was set to miss Saturday's game with Eibar but his yellow card has now been rescinded. Ronaldo was furious after being booked during Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday. Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez will miss Saturday's game after picking up bookings against Rayo but Real immediately decided to appeal the yellow card for their star forward. Speaking after the game, Carlo Ancelotti said: 'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty. 'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' That appeal has now been successful and Ronaldo - who netted his 300th goal for the club in Wednesday's win - will be part of Los Blancos' starting XI against Eibar.

Burnley host Tottenham on Sunday still fighting for top-flight survival, despite being written off as relegation certainties before the season began. Derby want Sean Dyche to replace Steve McClaren should the former England boss leave this summer. Dyche, 43, has won admirers for his plain speaking and organising a competitive team on a restricted budget. Derby, however, believe he will be tempted by a move to a bigger club — their average home gate of 29,000 is 10,000 more than Burnley get at Turf Moor. Derby occupy the final play-off place in the Championship, although Friday’s 2-2 draw against Watford was their seventh game in a row without a win. Derby boss McClaren has been linked with a move to Newcastle at the end of the season. It is almost certain, however, that McClaren and the club will part ways at the end of the season, whether they win promotion or not. McClaren was heavily backed to replace Alan Pardew at Newcastle earlier this season and insiders at Derby were unhappy at the way the story was highlighted in the public domain. Derby have been impressed with Dyche's work in the Premier League with Burnley this season. Since then, Derby’s form has gone off the boil and McClaren admitted after their last game that they could no longer go up automatically.

"'Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has heaped praise upon Loic Remy after the striker scored his second consecutive winner in the 2-1 victory over Stoke on Saturday.

Costa hobbled off 10 minutes after replacing Oscar at half-time, with another hamstring problem leaving him set for a spell on the sidelines.

'The tap-in when the goalkeeper has an incomplete save, attacking the ball on a low cross, rebounds - I love the easy goals from a striker.

"'Tottenham are confident Kyle Walker has not broken his foot following a scan on Tuesday. There were fears the England defender may have fractured his right foot after taking a hefty blow from a collision with Kieran Trippier during the draw at Burnley on Sunday. Results from the scan have shown up heavy bruising, but no fracture. However, more tests are planned this week. Tottenham defender Kyle Walker receives treatment from medical staff during the 0-0 draw with Burnley. Walker had sustained the injury following a heavy collision with Burnley defender Kieran Trippier at Turf Moor. Walker has been provided with a protective boot to ensure no further damage is caused. He will continue to be assessed by Spurs' medical team in the coming days as the club determine the full extent of the injury. But the early signs are that the 24-year-old will not be a long-term casualty, though a full diagnosis will be completed once swelling has fully subsided. Scans have revealed that Walker has not broken his foot and will hopefully return to action for Spurs soon.' ","#####
CONCERNED TOTTENHAM HAIL KNOCKER FOUGHT OFF BY CHELTENHAM
######
Tottenham were forced to hold on late on at Burnley to secure a point in a 0-0 draw while their north London rivals Arsenal suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of Crystal Palace.

Kyle Walker took a blow to the foot from a challenge by Kieran Trippier in the first half and immediately went to ground clutching his ankle, but manager Mauricio Pochettino refused to risk him and fielded him anyway after the break. The Englishman was unable to impact the game much despite wearing a protective boot, but neither was he involved in any rash challenges that might have put him out of commission for weeks.

Pochettino's decision to let Walker play through the pain ultimately backfired, however, as Cheltenham scored an equalizer in the 88th minute. It was enough to hand Spurs a deserved share of the points, but also served as a reminder that they are not immune to injuries that can derail their season.

The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-IT classes. However, research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices. Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim (stock image above) Courtney Blackwell, at Northwestern University in the US, found that, in tests, kindergarten children who shared iPads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no iPads or in which each student had their own device. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users. She worked with 352 students at a Midwestern suburban school district during the research. Miss Blackwell said the findings suggest it’s the ‘collaborative learning around the technology that made the difference, not just the collaboration in and of itself’.

Aircraft accidents happen but every once in a while something so dramatic occurs that it leaves everyone speechless. This is exactly what happened last weekend near the city of Melbourne when two planes collided mid-air, literally. The impact of the collision was so strong that one of the planes crashed onto the ground, while the other fell vertically down to the earth.

Thankfully, neither of the pilots involved suffered serious injuries. However, this does not take away the fact that such a collision could have ended terribly. According to the initial reports, one of the planes had sent out a Mayday alert prior to the collision. That might have contributed to the severity of the accident.

The sole survivor of the crashed plane was transported to a nearby hospital with minor injuries. Two passengers inside the other plane were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.

This is a shocking reminder that air travel is inherently risky. Despite all the modern advancements made in the field of aviation, accidents are still inevitable. Whether it involves malfunctioning parts, bad weather conditions or simply human error, things can go wrong at any time.

Aviation safety is paramount. Every precaution must be taken to ensure that pilots are well trained, planes are maintained met"," Two planes collided mid-air near Melbourne last weekend. | False |

"'Jose Mourinho has thickened up his Chelsea midfield for Sunday's west London derby at QPR. The Chelsea manager has been trialling a formation with Ramires and Nemanja Matic in front of the back four as the league leaders head to Loftus Road. Mourinho has stuck with the team that it is likely to mean a more advanced role for Cesc Fabregas in the 'No10' position behind Didier Drogba up front, with fellow striker Loic Remy out injured. Brazilian midfielder Oscar has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea's last 11 games. Eden Hazard, who Mourinho believes is the only realistic candidate to be named PFA player of the year, starts on the left. Willian will start on the right and his Brazilian team-mate Oscar may drop out of the starting line up for the clash at QPR. Chelsea are four points clear of Arsenal with two games in hand and Mourinho does not want to take any chances at Loftus Road. Chelsea's Nemanja Matic (right), in action against Stoke, is set to feature again in the heart of midfield.

"'It has long been a highlight of the racing calender - and the ladies of Liverpool certainly didn't disappoint  with fashion and drunken frolics once again taking centre stage. Trotting into Aintree in a collection of floral, flamboyant and eye-catching numbers, thousands of female race-goers displayed their indomitable spirit for the occasion. Clearly taking the 'Chanel-inspired' style guide to heart, many opted for outfits that wouldn't have been out of place at a wedding - whether as part of the bridal party or as the bride herself. Others seemed to have taken heed of the sunshine and instead sported full-skirted looks bedecked with blooms in pastel shades of lemon, periwinkle and peach. Most, however, were intent on nothing more than enjoying the blissful weather with many opening proceedings with a mini bottle of champagne, quaffed with the help of a booze funnel. The occasion may have commenced with glamorous group photos and sunny selfies but as Ladies' Day rolled on, the hours of drinking appeared to take their toll, not only on the female race fans but their outfits as well. Wardrobe malfunctions hit many a low-cut dress and thigh-length frock and some even chose to flash their bottom for photographers, while others struggled to keep their composure on a wooden racehorse. As the mid-afternoon sun beamed over Aintree, balancing in high heels and platforms presented more of a challenge and race-goers were seen staggering around the grounds. It wasn't just the ladies who were making the most of the occasion. Aintree's gentlemen were also out in full force, with one group donning a particularly garish selection of suits.'

Some wore outfits inspired by the Chanel Coco Mademoiselle perfume campaign, while others embraced the sunshine with bright colors and floral prints.

The men, meanwhile, kept up with the fashion frenzy, sporting colorful bow ties, sharp blazers, and elegant tuxedo jackets. Many of them also enjoyed a glass of champagne during the reception.

But the highlight of the day was undoubtedly the fashion show, where attendees got to see the latest trends from top designers. The models strutted down the runway in stunning gowns and cocktail attire, leaving the audience oohing and ahhing.

Pentagon officials have slammed the move as 'unprofessional' and 'unsafe'. A Russian jet 'aggressively' intercepted a U.S. RC-135U plane (pictured) over Poland, the Pentagon claims. Spokesman Mark Wright told CNN the Russian jet performed 'aggressive maneuvers' at high speed in close proximity to the plane. He added that the State Department will consequently be filing a complaint to Russia 'through diplomatic channels'. Russia has rubbished claims it was a deliberate and aggressive interception. State news agency Sputnik reported that the jet was circling the plane to determine its tail number, as its transponder was switched off. The Russian SU-27 Flanker 'aggressively' cut into the American plane's path, the spokesman stated. The Pentagon and the U.S. European Command have dismissed the account. The incident occurred almost exactly a year after Pentagon officials accused a Russian fighter jet of purposely flying 100 feet in front of the nose of an American spy plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan. In August last year, U.S. Air Force spy plane avoided a run-in with the Russian military over Swedish airspace.' ","##### #####

<bot>: When a dog is ""panting,"" it means that the dog is breathing through its mouth while running or exercising. This is normal, and it helps to cool down the body during exercise by releasing sweat onto the tongue and into the lungs. Dogs use their tongues to clean off loose food particles and lubricate the mouth during oral sex with other dogs. Panting is one way in which they can regulate their body temperature while also providing them with another source of hydration. Some dogs may appear to be panting more than others, particularly during summer months when they feel the heat. However, if you see your dog panting excessively even during colder weather, it may indicate that they are suffering from dehydration or overheating.

"'While most football fans face travel misery over Easter, Manchester City have laid on free coaches to take their supporters to London for Monday's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace. The reigning champions have shelled out for six coaches to transport around 3,000 people to Selhurst Park, notoriously one of the most difficult top flight grounds for Northern club fans to reach. The move was made after TV scheduling for the 8pm kick-off made it virtually impossible for supporters to return home by either train or plane on the same night. David Silva (right) celebrates scoring in City's 3-0 defeat of Crystal Palace earlier this season. Around 300 City fans have been afforded free travel on six coaches to take them to Selhurst Park. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of football fans are facing a travel nightmare this weekend because of the Easter rail shut down. Despite more than 30 Premiership and Championship games scheduled for the long weekend, large parts of the rail network are set to be closed for repair works. More than half the games are set to be affected by delays and disruption, forcing fans onto the roads. Many grounds will not reach full capacity over Easter as rail closures disrupt travel plans. Labour has accused the Government of failing to learn from the Boxing Day chaos, when nearly a million football fans faced nightmare journeys to follow their team. Ministers were warned of the potential problems in advance Labour has claimed – but they failed to scrutinise the planned level of maintenance work.

"'Chelsea could move for Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda in the summer. The club's technical director Michael Emenalo travelled to Spain on Saturday to watch the defender during Atletico's 2-2 draw with Malaga, according to Spanish newspaper AS. The 31-year-old has one year left on his contract and Atletico are reportedly keen to cash in this summer. Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda (left) competes for the ball with Real Sociedad's Mikel Gonzalez. Miranda has also been offered to Manchester United and Manchester City, but both clubs are more interested in the Brazilian's team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez. Chelsea and Atletico held talks over Miranda last summer when Jose Mourinho's side moved to sign Diego Costa and Felipe Luis, but the defender rejected a move to London – as well as United – to remain in Madrid. But the presence of Costa and Luis at Stamford Bridge coupled with the emergence of Gimenez as a regular at Atletico may convince Miranda to join Chelsea this time around. Miranda currently has a year left on his contract and has yet to agree a new deal with the Spanish side. Earlier in the month, however, Miranda rejected talk that he would leave Atletico. Asked about speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford, Miranda told Brazilian website Estadao: 'Of course this news reaches me, and it makes me happy. It shows I am doing well. 'It makes me proud, but my intention is to stay at Atletico because I still have a year and a half on my contract.' The emergence of defender Jose Maria Gimenez at Atletico may influence Miranda's decision this summer.' ","##### Sure

A club statement said: ‘An initial scan on Saturday ruled out a fracture, but a follow up scan last night confirmed ligament damage that will keep the January signing from Spurs out for around six weeks. ‘With just seven league games left, it’s a blow for Naughton and the Swans with the right-back continuing to impress with every appearance.’ Angel Rangel will return to the side to face Everton on Saturday. Rangel said: ‘It’s not good because Kyle has an injury and I don’t wish bad on anyone, but from my point of view I always try and be ready so if the manager needs me I’ll try my best.’ Naughton will miss the rest of the season and had to helped off the pitch by the Swansea team physios. Meyler looks shocked as referee Andre Marriner shows him a straight red, a decision that was justified.' ","#####
CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION – SECTIONAL BERINGANGS
#####
The **concrete construction** system is based on the sectioning of materials and
their subsequent placement and compaction according to a specific process
that is optimized for each material type. Concrete technology has developed
to a considerable extent during the 20th century; until the 1950s, concrete
was considered a rather ""unscientific"" material.

There are three main types of concrete construction:

1.   #####PILINGS AND COLUMNS
These are the structural foundations of everything on earth that is above
ground. Pilings and columns can be made of steel, brick, stone, or concrete.
Concrete is most often used because it is the least expensive of the
recommended options.

    ****Column and piling design****
A concrete column or piling is designed according to a standardized
dimensional table called the «American Society for Testing and Materials
Table 6.1». Columns are dimensioned either as _nominal_ dimensions (the
actual dimensions allowed to vary within certain limits) or as actual
dimensions (irrespective of tolerances). Dimensional tolerances of
reinforcement are specified"," Concrete construction involves sectioning materials and placing them according to a specific process optimized for each material type. | False |

"'Liverpool are watching Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia. The France international was one of the most coveted players in Europe prior to signing for the wealthy French club from Sevilla in 2013. Real Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus and Paris St Germain were all keen. Geoffrey Kondogbia has impressed Liverpool scouts this season in Europe and Ligue 1. Kondogbia celebrates after scoring against Arsenal in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 clash. Kondogbia pictured in action for France against Denmark during the recent international break. He had an initial dip in form after his move but has since kicked on again and has impressed Liverpool scouts in Europe and the French league this season. The 22-year-old was key to Monaco's Champions League victory over Arsenal, particularly in their first leg performance at The Emirates and is back on the radar of other big clubs. Kondogbia has represented France three times and has made 23 appearances for Monaco this season. Liverpool remain keen on bringing Danny Ings, whose contract expires in the summer, to Anfield from Burnley. Club also monitoring James Milner as his Manchester City contract expires at the end of the season. Liverpool's budget and attraction will hinge on qualification for the Champions League which Brendan Rodgers admits looks slim. They remain in the frame for James Milner and Danny Ings. The English duo's contacts are set to expire at the end of the season with neither player looking likely to extend their current deals. Milner would be available for nothing should he decide to leave Manchester City, while a compensation fee would have to be agreed between Liverpool and Burnley for Ings because of his age.'

"'Real Sociedad remain hopeful over a deal for Burnley striker Danny Ings. Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United have all shown interest in the England Under 21 international but have yet to sign him up as they consider other options also. Ings has interest from Borussia Monchengladbach among others but Sociedad have remained constant from the start. Real Sociedad are still hopeful of singing Burnley striker Danny Ings when his contract expires in the summer. Michel Vorm saves from Ings as the Burnley forward passes up a great chance to give his side the lead against Tottenham on Sunday. England Under 21 international Ings chats with Harry Kane after the final whistle at Turf Moor. The 23-year-old knows he can play regularly there, will be watched with interest by England coach Roy Hodgson and will get the money he wants. Sociedad manager David Moyes has taken the club into the top half of La Liga and intends to build on that in the summer and Ings could prove a key acquisition. Ings' contract at Burnley expires in the summer and is unlikely to sign another one regardless of their ability to survive relegation this season. Should Ings move to another Premier League club Burnley would be due a sizeable compensation fee because of his age, but that fee would be nominal if the striker moved abroad.' ","###########

"'Cesc Fabregas showed off the result of a nasty-looking clash with Charlie Adam's arm during Chelsea's victory against Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The Blues extended their lead at the top of Barclays Premier League to seven points with a 2-1 win but it didn't come without cost for Spain international Fabregas. The former Barcelona midfielder was left bloodied after being caught by a flailing arm following a tussle with Adam, the scorer of a 66-yard wonder goal. Cesc Fabregas reveals the nasty-looking gash on his nose sustained during Chelsea's win against Stoke. Fabregas was caught in the face by Stoke City midfielder Charlie Adam's flailing arm. The collision left the Spain international with a bloody nose and requiring treatment. Spain international Fabregas also took a whack on his leg during the clash on Saturday. Fabregas took to Instagram after the game on Saturday to show off his battle scar - a large gash across the top of his swollen nose. 'At least I might be able to fix my nose after all... Good win today!' Fabregas wrote alongside the picture on the social media site. It is not the first time that the 27-year-old's hooter has been in the wars.

Chelsea extended their lead at the top of the English Premier League standings to seven points with a thrilling 2-1 home win over Stoke City on Saturday.  

The victory came at a cost, however, as captain and playmaker Cesc Fabregas required eight stitches to close a cut above his eye after being accidentally flattened by Stoke's Charlie Adam.  

Fabregas was caught in the face by Stoke's Scotland international midfielder, whose wild tackle prompted referee Mike Dean to point to the spot moments later.  

The Spain international revealed afterwards that he had also taken a kick to his thigh in the frantic match, while teammate Branislav Ivanovic was forced out of the game with a suspected hamstring problem.  

Fabregas was keen to downplay the significance of his injury woes, though, joking about his appearance on social media and insisting that the defeat was ""not nice"" but that the team would bounce back stronger in future.  

""It could have been worse,"" he told reporters when asked about his injuries. ""I'm fine. It's part of football.

"'Brendan Rodgers is considering recalling £20million misfit defender Dejan Lovren at Blackburn in the FA Cup on Wednesday to help save Liverpool’s season. The trip to Ewood Park for a quarter-final replay has even more significance as in comes in the wake of successive morale-sapping Premier League defeats by Manchester United and Arsenal. Saturday’s 4-1 loss at the Emirates was marked by the kind of shaky defending that blighted Liverpool’s early-season play. Brendan Rodgers is ready to recall his out-of-favour defender Dejan Lovren for the FA Cup quarter-final. Lovren has been out of the Liverpool team recently, but could return against Blackburn on Wednesday. Now — with Emre Can and Martin Skrtel both suspended — Rodgers is set to bring in Lovren after opting for veteran Kolo Toure ahead of him at the weekend. ‘Kolo gives everything every single day so I knew what I would get with him at Arsenal,” said Rodgers. ‘Dejan was out over the international break but he is looking strong. He will be in contention.’ Lovren has made only 16 league starts since he was signed last summer from Southampton but the Croatian may have to step up as Rodgers sticks with the three-man defensive system that helped turn around Liverpool’s season in December. Kolo Toure was given a torrid time by Arsenal as he reutrned in the place of suspended Martin Skrtel. Rodgers says he knows what to expect from Toure, but could turn to Lovren for the must-win game. Liverpool were thrashed 4-1 by Arsenal, and now the FA Cup represents their last chance for a good season.' ","#####

"'Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar was left fuming after being substituted by Luis Enrique during the 2-2 draw at Sevilla on Saturday night, according to reports in Spain. Neymar, who scored his side's second goal with a curling free kick, was replaced with the score at 2-1 and 15 minutes to play. Sevilla then scored a late equaliser, and Neymar 'can't understand why he is subbed so much' reports Spanish paper Sport.

The paper points out that the forward has been replaced in 15 of his 34 matches this season, with only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta being substituted more. With Barcelona still top of La Liga, and challenging for a treble, the paper points out that the club will need to be united in the final run-in. Elsewhere in Spain the attention is focused on the Madrid derby in this week's Champions League quarter-finals. Marca claims that the game is 'like a final', with the two teams playing out a repeat of last year's showdown in Lisbon, while in AS, Real defender Pepe calls for intensity and humility. In Italy the headlines are dominated by Lazio, who moved above their city rivals Roma into second place in Serie A with a win over Empoli.

Neymar was furious after being substituted against Sevilla on Saturday, reports say.
Neymar, who scored a brilliant free kick to make it 2-1, was taken off after an hour of play, which seems to be becoming a common occurrence lately.

With 16 goals and 7 assists this season, Neymar is one of Barca's most important players, but he has had to deal with a lot of substitution lately.
Only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta have been substituted more times than Neymar this season.
Luis Enrique's explanation for taking off Neymar against Sevilla doesn't seem to have appeased the striker, and the situation seems to be getting worse instead of better.

It’s disgusting.' And David Morgan added: 'Let the nightmares begin.' Others were more impressed by Limmy’s vine. Marina insisted: 'This is the best thing I’ve ever seen.'

**Abstract:**

In this day and age, where everything is fast-paced and busy, there is always room for something slow and steady. Skipping meals, eating poorly, and subsisting on caffeine and sugar are common habits today. However, such behavior can lead to an array of health issues. Furthermore, such habits can have a negative impact on cognitive function, energy levels, and even mood. In contrast, incorporating whole foods into one's diet, such as fruits and vegetables, can provide essential nutrients to help maintain good health. Not only does a well-rounded diet ensure that the body has all the necessary components to function at its best, but it also helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Therefore, by making small changes to one's dietary habits, such as avoiding processed foods and eating more fiber-rich foods, individuals can enjoy improved physical and mental wellbeing.

**Introduction:**

Eating well has never been more important, yet sustaining ourselves with the right balance of vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, and healthy fats has become challenging.

"'Japan's J-League is just four games into a new season, but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent's face. Videos of the South Korean defender Kim Min Hyeok, who plays for Sagan Tosu, have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent Mu Kanazaki. Sagan are ninth in the J-League and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed Kashima Antlers player Kanazaki. Kim Min Hyeok (left) and Mu Kanazaki (right) fight it out for the ball on the wing during a J-League clash. After Kanazaki went down, it is alleged that Hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent. Despite the vicious looking nature of Hyeok’s apparent attack and Kanazaki’s dramatic clutch to his face, the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on, much to the fans' uproar. Whether or not the foul was intentional, it is suspected that the reason for Japanese  fans’ outcry is not so much the act itself, but the fact that it was committed by a South Korean player. Hyeok's boot appears to scrape down Kanazaki's face, but the man on the floor came out as the winner later. Hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium. Some Japanese fans have demanded not only the expulsion of Hyeok, but of all South Koreans, from the game. However, regardless of the controversy, justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on player’s team won 3-1, with Kanazaki among the goals.' ","#####Squad

Jose Mourinho's side extended their lead at the top of Barclays Premier League to seven points with a 2-1 win but it didn't come without cost for Fabregas. The former Arsenal and Barcelona ace was left bloodied after being caught by a flailing arm following a tussle with Adam, the scorer of a 66-yard wonder goal. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas took to Instagram to show off the shiner he picked up from Charlie Adam. Fabregas was caught in the face by Stoke City midfielder Adam's flailing arm during their game. The collision left the Spain international with a bloody nose and requiring treatment. However, the Spanish international was all smiles on Tuesday as he posted a picture to his Instagram account with the caption: 'Italy with Dr Paco' Earlier in the week Fabregas joked that he could finally get his nose fixed and the 27-year-old's comments suggest he is going to do exactly that. It is not the first time that the Spaniard's hooter has been in the wars. While an Arsenal player in 2008, Fabregas suffered a broken nose playing for Spain. He avoided having an operation on the injury then, but it seems that he may be happy to change that this time round.' ","##### SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES

'I had an interview this morning, and I said ""well, all I've got to do is go out and win the Par-3 and make a hole and one"", and I make a hole in one,' Nicklaus said afterwards. The ace was Nicklaus' first on the hallowed turf of Augusta, but the veteran saw his achievement eclipsed by that of Camilo Villegas on a day which saw five hole-in-ones, levelling the record from 2002. The Colombian followed Nicklaus with an ace on the fourth and also managed one on the eighth, but he couldn't quite land the title, losing out to world No 74 Kevin Streelman in a play-off. Nicklaus became the youngest person to wear a green jacket in 1963, and collected his sixth in 1986. He is one of five men to complete the career grand slam, an accolade which favourite Rory McIlroy can achieve if he wins his third major in succession.' ","###########

"'They say you should never forget your roots. Even more so in the case of this striking tree spotted in southern China. The banyan tree in Guangxi province does not stand on a single trunk, but a whole web of roots. It has captured the attention of locals, who say they have watched the whole thing sway in the wind due to its flimsy structure, reported the People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video. Fairy tale: The Banyan looks like enchanted trees found in children’s books. Uprooted: The original tree roots grew up against a wall, before it was moved to a nearby park. Originally the roots of the tree grew up against a wall, but when the wall was demolished the tree was carefully uprooted to its new location Northern Gulf Marine and Cultural Park in Fangchenggang city. The roots then became the trunk of the tree, leading to its strange appearance. These photos show how the entangled trunks look like something straight out of the Enchanted Forest. It is truly remarkable that the web of overlapping roots can support the weight of the tree above. Banyan trees are found in hot climates and known for their extensive roots. Sometimes the roots grow so out of control that they eventually engulf the tree and kill it. Another webbed tree trunk as shown in the video below was spotted in a public park last December in Nanning City -- also in Guangxi -- where monster roots have grown to create a trellis effect.

"'Second-half goals by Mohamed Yattara and Alexandre Lacazette helped Olympique Lyonnais go top of Ligue 1 with a 2-0 home win against Bastia on Wednesday.

Lyon's Jordan Ferri dribbled past a defender before his curling shot was superbly saved by Alphonse Areola in the sixth minute. Areola was at it again when he blocked Steed Malbranque's back heel on the half hour and tipped away Clinton Njie's low shot three minutes before the break as Lyon continued to dominate. Lacazette seals victory and top spot in the French Ligue 1 for Lyon in the second half. Frenchman Lacazette is the top scorer in Ligue 1 this season with 25 goals to his name. Malbranque was substituted in the 62nd minute and replaced with France international Clement Grenier, who was making his comeback after an eight-month injury layoff.

"'It takes a lot to impress Barcelona's all-star cast of players, but young defender Martin Montoya provoked gasps from his team-mates with an outrageous trick shot during training. The young Spanish defender made his hoop dreams come true by netting a lofted pass from around 30 yards 'downtown' straight into a basketball ring on the other side of the club's Ciutat Esportiva training ground. After the ball drops into the net, a group of watching players applaud while others, including Ivan Rakitic and Javier Mascherano, race over to congratulate the 23-year-old left-back.

"'Conceding three goals would be embarrassment enough for any goalkeeper, but Rob Green was forced to suffer even more humiliation at the hands of a ball boy on Monday night. As the clock ticked down during QPR's 3-3 away draw with Aston Villa, a cheeky youngster decided to while away a few more seconds by mugging off the former England No 1 with a handmade nutmeg. The ball boy, who initially shames himself by slipping over while retrieving the ball, toys with Green by pretending to hand him the ball back before rolling it between the clearly frustrated 35-year-old's legs. The Villa ball boy (front left) initially slips over while retrieving the ball behind QPR's goal. The Rangers No 1 smiles as he moves to retrieve the ball from the youngster during the 3-3 draw. The cheeky lad decides to embarrass the former England stopper by rolling the ball through his legs. The 35-year-old shows his frustration as the young prankster makes a swift exit. Green is no stranger to blooper reel moments, having let Clint Dempsey's shot slip through his fingers in the 1-1 draw with USA at the 2010 World Cup - a mistake that cost him his place at the tournament. Belgium powerhouse Christian Benteke ensured the points were shared at Villa Park by scoring a hat-trick against their his fellow relegation strugglers to move three points clear of the  safety zone. Having scored seven goals and taken four points from their last two games in a bid to beat relegation, Rangers host Premier League leaders Chelsea at Loftus Park on Sunday.

Saint-Andre succeeded Marc Lievremont (above) following the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand.' ","##### Considered the favorite ######

Lievremont was successful as a player with Brive but left at the end of the 1989–90 season to become coach of Agen. His greatest success came against foreign opposition where he led Racing to victory in the European Challenge Cup in 1998. However, off the pitch, the club were struggling financially and Lievremont resigned after being handed a two-year suspended prison sentence for illegal wage protection.[5]

Following the World Cup, Lievremont was replaced by Philippe Saint-Andre, who led France to the final of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

Saint-André's reign got off to a shaky start as France finished fourth in the 2012 Six Nations, their worst ever finish in the tournament. Following the 2014 Six Nations, Saint-Andre announced his intention to step down as France coach after the World Cup. On 21 March 2015, France defeated Wales in the round 4 of the 2015 Six Nations, thus guaranteeing themselves at least a second place finish in the standings, which would allow them to compete directly at the 2019 Rugby World Cup. On 10 June 2015, France qualified for the 2015 Rugby World Cup after Chile lost to Argentina.

"'Ben Stokes thought he had claimed his 23rd Test wicket when Jermaine Blackwood slashed his short delivery straight to Alastair Cook at slip. But the Durham all-rounder’s front foot had crossed the line and the batsman earned a reprieve. It’s not the first time this has happened to Stokes, of course — a similar error saw him denied his first Test wicket against Australia in Adelaide in 2013. Ben Stokes was denied the wicket of Jermaine Blackwood after overstepping the crease. Stokes overstepped the line when he thought he had England's fifth wicket of the day in Antigua. Stokes celebrated wildly when Brad Haddin was caught behind on that occasion, and the pair clashed when the decision was overturned. Michael Vaughan, while commentating on BBC’s Test Match Special, thinks the 23-year-old should return to his natural style of bowling. ‘Stokes is trying to be a very English-type bowler,’ Vaughan said. ‘But when I’ve seen him bowl really well, I’ve seen him bowl short spells: really fast, with lots of bouncers.’ England gather in celebration of Stokes' wicket, only for it to be overturned by the umpire. Vaughan’s BBC colleague, Jonathan Agnew, thinks England will rue Tuesday’s showing. ‘England will look back on today as a missed opportunity in terms of batting,’ he said. ‘They still have the advantage, they’ve kept chipping away with wickets and they’ve kept things very tight, but they could have done with that Blackwood wicket.’' ","##### Sure! Here's a summary of the article: #####

**Who:** The text is about **Ben Stokes**, a professional cricketer who plays for the England national team as a batter and a slow left-arm orthodox bowler.

**What:** When playing a match against West Indies in Antigua, Stokes believed that he had taken the wicket of the last man, Jermaine Blackmon, but unfortunately, he overstepped the crease and the batsman survived. This incident has become famous as ""the overthrow"" in the cricket world.

Stokes has previously experienced a similar situation in an international match against Australia in 2013 where he also bowled short of the crease and took the wicket of Australian batsman Brad Haddin, but the catch was controversially called caught behind due to overstepping the crease.

**Where:** The match was played at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua.

"'Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive. Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua. Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning. Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’.' ","##### Top 3 Constipation Homeopathic Medicines
##### 1. Psorinum
Psorinum is one of the most commonly used homeopathic medicines for treating chronic constipation. It is highly effective in treating cases where straining during bowel movements is the predominant symptom. This medicine works by gently stimulating the nervous system and restoring balance to the musculoskeletal system.

##### 2. Tuberculinum
Tuberculinum is a great remedy for slow digestion and constipation. The patient feels that nothing passes smoothly and that even the slightest exertion makes him or her feel tired. There is a feeling of something wanting to pass but not being able to. The bowels become regular and hard stools are passed.

##### 3. Arsenicum Album
Arsenicum album is another common homeopathic medicine for constipation. It is useful in cases where the patient experiences severe constipation with cramping, abdominal pain, and bloating. The medicine works by inducing a state of anxiety in the body, which stimulates the release of intestinal gas and stool.

"'West Ham have been dealt a blow by the news that Diafra Sakho could be out for the rest of the season with a thigh injury. The 25-year-old striker came off after 58 minutes of Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Stoke with a thigh strain. He was sent for scans on Monday amid fears he may have a minor tear and club physios are hopeful it is not as severe as first thought. Diafra Sakho limps off against Stoke after 58 minutes to be replaced by Carlton Cole. The West Ham striker has scored 12 goals this season, but could be out for the rest of the campaign. His absence will still come as a blow to West Ham's aspirations of finishing high up the table. The Senegal international has been a big success following his £3.5million summer move from Metz and has scored 12 goals this season. Enner Valencia is also doubtful to face Manchester City at the weekend after sustaining a foot injury when he was trodden on by a Stoke player on Saturday.

","#####

Diafra Sakho, the striker for West Ham United, has suffered an injury that could keep him out for the remainder of the season.

Sakho sustained a thigh injury during his team's match against Stoke City on Saturday, and after undergoing tests, it has been revealed that he may have a minor tear in his thigh.

The 25-year-old striker has already missed several games this season due to various injuries, and his latest setback will be a major blow to the team's hopes of achieving a top-six finish in the Premier League.

In addition to Sakho's injury, Enner Valencia, who also plays up front for the team, is struggling with a foot injury that he sustained during the same game against Stoke.

The Ecuadorian international has missed the last few matches for West Ham, and it remains to be seen whether he will be fit in time to face Manchester City at the weekend.

West Ham currently sit in ninth place in the league table, seven points behind sixth-place Tottenham Hotspur, and they will need to recover quickly from these recent setbacks if they want to close the gap on the teams above them.

"'Arsenal should target Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech if he leaves Stamford Bridge at the end of the season, insists Carlo Cudicini. Cech has made just five Barclays Premier League appearances this season as Thibaut Courtois remains manager Jose Mourinho's first-choice goalkeeper. But Cudicini feels the 32-year-old Czech Republic international would be a good fit under Arsene Wenger instead of Wojciech Szczesny at Arsenal. Petr Cech, in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week, is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer. Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has made just five Premier League appearances this season. Chelsea want at least £10million for Cech, and they would have to sell to a direct rival for the goalkeeper to end up at the Emirates. Prompted on TalkSport by Ray Parlour who said Arsenal 'have to get' Cech, Cudicini added: 'I agree. 'Arsenal have had a few problems with goalkeepers after [David] Seaman and [Jens] Lehmann. 'Szczesny is still struggling to impose himself as number one, so if a goalkeeper like Petr Cech is available in the summer, obviously he should be a big target for Arsenal.'

"'A once in a lifetime shot, they said, but it appears Charlie Adam has done it before. The Stoke midfielder has been the talk of football this Easter weekend after his incredible 66-yard goal against Chelsea. Adam's sweetly struck left-footed strike gave goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois absolutely no chance. Scroll down to watch video of Charlie Adam scoring from the halfway line in 2009. Charlie Adam picks the ball up inside his own half during a reserve match against Accrington Stanley. Adam knocks the ball out in front of him before spotting the goalkeeper of his line and shooting. The Stanley keeper tries desperately to stop the ball as it sails towards the goal. The goalkeeper is left sprawled on the floor as the ball hits the back of the net. And that is not the first time the Scot has had a goalkeeper frantically back-pedalling before picking the ball out of his own net. Back in 2009, Adam scored a similar effort for Blackpool reserves against Accrington Stanley. He was in the opposition half this time though was out wide before hitting an effort that draws similarities with David Beckham's famous goal against Wimbledon in 1996. The stage, it has to be said, was far smaller too, though it's easy to see why Adam backed himself at Stamford Bridge on this evidence.'

Italy international continues stellar career despite advanced age  
(CNN) — He may be the oldest player in the competition but Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon isn't ready to call time on his storied career just yet. The veteran shot stopper, who will turn 38 years old next month, starred once again as Juventus secured a crucial away goal in their Champions League last-eight tie against Monaco on Tuesday.  
The future of Italian football's most prolific goalkeeper had been under intense scrutiny heading into the clash at Juve's Allianz Stadium -- the pair played to a dull 0-0 draw in the Principality in March. But having prevented the Ligue 1 side from finding the net on this occasion either, Buffon stressed that he was not considering retirement despite many criticizing him for continuing to play at such an advanced age.

The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com. The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While Maneul has received just three patient survey responses on HealthGrades.com, those responses were quite positive.

Clearly incensed by his side's lack of concentration, Maaskant turned to his bench and threw a devastating right hook to the side of the dugout. The 46-year-old clearly packs a punch because his attack sent his fist clean through the plastic casing, cutting his hand. It goes without saying we wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of a Maaskant rant. It's lucky NAC's wobble didn't occur before they headed into the changing rooms at half time... with all those football boots lying around.' ","##### NAC BREDA VS FC DORDRECHT

Maradona addressed the crowd during his visit to Bogotá to support the peace process in Colombia.
He stated that he came to Colombia to support ""the beautiful game"" and to show his solidarity with the Colombian people, who have been suffering from a long-standing civil war.
However, his mission to promote peace was not completely successful, as he also found time to engage in a bit of old-fashioned football hooliganism.
While attending a charity match in Bogotá, Colombia, Maradona lost his temper when a steward tried to stop him from celebrating on the field after scoring a goal.
In the midst of giving a post-goal interview, Maradona snapped and began attacking the steward with a series of vicious kicks.
At one point, he even tries to hit the camera man recording the incident.
Despite his best efforts, Maradona was unable to score another goal, and the match ended in a 1-1 draw.
It is unclear what happened to the steward who attempted to stop Maradona from celebrating, but it is clear that the incident has tarnished Maradona's reputation as a role model and a humanitarian.

And winning their subsequent games – with Aberdeen doing likewise – could see Ronny Deila’s team win their fourth successive championship in the north east.

The Parkhead side have two Friday night fixtures against Dundee and St Johnstone – and won’t play another game on Saturday at 3pm this season. If Celtic wrap up the league flag they will be presented with the trophy before their final home game against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on May 24, the final day of the season. Aberdeen will play St Johnstone in their final game, with the top six completed by a Dundee derby. The Scottish Premiership leaders face nearest rivals Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Sunday, May 10.

The news could have been worse for Carney, who dislocated his elbow in the Tigers' 25-4 win over Hull KR last Saturday but did not suffer a break as first feared. Castleford winger Justin Carney is set to be out for up to months after being told he needs elbow surgery.

1. The External Genitalia: In general, males have penis and females have vulva. But in snakes, they have phallus and vagina, respectively.

2. Number of Teeth: Snakes do not have any teeth in their upper jaw. But they have about 28-30 rows of teeth in their lower jaw.

3. Arms/Fingers: Snakes usually have around 88-96 vertebrae in their body. But they lack forelimbs or arms. They use their mouth to grip prey and move it before swallowing.

4. Ears: Snakes lack ears but they can detect low-frequency sounds.

5. Tail: Unlike mammals, snakes don’t have tail. It is believed that losing the tail is beneficial for moving fast. So, it is likely that the snake evolved its absence recently.

6. Eyelids: Snakes keep their eyelids closed when not in use. But they have poor sight and rely more on touch and smell.

7. Sexes: Male and female snakes are called being “equal”, because they have similar genetic material"," Males have a penis, females have a vulva, while snakes have a phallus and vagina, respectively. | False |

"'Rangers have been fined £5,500 by the Scottish Football Association after admitting the previous board breached 'dual ownership' rules by allowing Newcastle chief Mike Ashley into Ibrox. The Sports Direct tycoon owns 9.82 per cent of the Glasgow giants but is prohibited from going over 10 per cent by an agreement struck with Hampden chiefs designed to limit his power at Ibrox. But that did not stop Ashley exerting influence. Two of his closest associates - Derek Llambias and Barry Leach - sat as directors until King forced them out at last month's general meeting. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley bought a 9.8 per cent stake in Rangers and loaned the club £5million. Ashley gave the club's old board a £5million loan in January which remains outstanding. That agreement gives the 50-year-old a floating charge on the club as well as security on a number of assets, including Murray Park and the club's registered trademarks. Representatives of the new board arrived at Hampden at 2pm on Thursday to appear before the SFA's Judicial Panel. Ashley's close associate Derek Llambias sat as director as Ashley exerted his influence. During a three-hour meeting they admitted the club had breached Disciplinary Rule 1, which requires member clubs to 'behave towards the Scottish FA and other members with the utmost good faith' - and were fined £5,000. A second fine of £500 was also imposed after Rangers admitted a breach of Disciplinary Rule 19 - which relates to dual ownership. Ashley - the world's 306th richest man, worth an estimated £3.3billion - was fined £7,500 for breaching Disciplinary Rule 19 last month.' ","##### FINED £5000

Pictures leaked by a website purporting to show possible designs for Real Madrid's kits for the 2018-19 season suggest the club could ditch their controversial ""Barca blue"" strip for something rather more conservative - but undeniably stylish.

The images, published by a site called purelyfootball.com, show what appear to be the proposed designs for both Real's home and away strips for the upcoming campaign.

Whilst the home shirt appears to maintain the three white stripes of this season's kit, the colours are slightly different and the pattern is much more refined.

Gone are the pinstripes of recent years; in their place, there are thin horizontal stripes of navy blue and white, echoing the colours of the club's famous white jersey with red trim.

The design also retains the rounded hem and cuffs which characterised this season's shirt, whilst the latter takes on an almost triangular shape at the bottom, giving the appearance of a sock.

The away kit, meanwhile, eschews the club's traditional white jersey in favour of a sky blue template with three yellow stripes on the sleeves.

"'West Ham striker Diafra Sakho is out for the remainder of the season after tearing a thigh muscle on Saturday against Stoke City. The 25-year-old is West Ham's runaway top scorer this season with 12 goals and was forced off after 59 minutes during their 1-1 draw at home. West Ham claimed Sakho could return 'before the end of the season' on their official website, but it appears unlikely the Senegal international will be fit enough to feature before the next campaign.

The West Ham striker has scored 12 goals this season but is set to miss the rest of the campaign. Ten of Sakho's 12 goals came in the Barclays Premier League, with Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing the club's next top scorers with just five apiece.

Fernando Torres (centre) scored his first ever league own goal during Atletico Madrid's 2-2 draw with Malaga. The Malaga players celebrate Torres' own goal which pulled the visitors level just before half-time. Atletico were gifted the opening goal as Malaga keeper Carlos Kameni flapped at a long throw by Jesus Gamez and it was left for Antoinne Griezmann to simply knock the ball over the line from close range. Malaga caused little threat in a cagey first half but were given a helping hand by Torres who headed past Jan Oblak. The game opened up in the second half and Malaga midfielder Samu delicately chipped the ball over Oblak with 20 minutes left.

CONCRETE LANDSCAPE TRIBUTE TO PAUL KLEE

In this work, the artist has used color, form, and texture to create a concrete landscape that pays homage to Paul Klee, one of the most important modern artists. The work is an abstract representation of a garden, with its various shapes, colors, and textures. The title, ""Concrete Landscape,"" suggests the materiality of the artwork, suggesting that it is both a representation of a landscape and a physical object itself. This duality is consistent with Klee's artistic philosophy, which emphasized the importance of improvisation, spontaneity, and the incorporation of unexpected elements into his artworks.

The use of concrete in the artwork adds a sense of permanence and solidity to the piece, while also referencing the industrial materials often used by modern artists. The poured concrete gives the work a sense of weight and gravity, further emphasizing the importance of materiality in the creation of this piece. The uneven surface of the concrete reflects light in unique ways, adding another layer of complexity to the work.

Overall, this sculpture serves as a testament to the power of abstraction and the ability of art to transcend reality and capture something deeper and more universal"," The artwork is a concrete landscape tribute to Paul Klee. | False |

"'Juventus moved ever closer to clinching a fourth straight Serie A title by beating nearest challengers Lazio 2-0 in Turin. First-half goals from Carlos Tevez - his 26th of the season in all competitions - and centre-back Leonardo Bonucci pushed Juve 15 points clear of second place with only seven games remaining.

'Benzema is not available (for Saturday) but we will have him back for the next game,' added the Italian. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out of his side's La Liga match against Malaga. Benzema rolls around on the floor during Real Madrid's quarter-final clash against rivals Atletico. Losing their first-choice striker, even if just for one match, is a blow to the European champions at a crucial stage of the season. Benzema has scored 15 goals during the La Liga campaign and six in the Champions League this term. Ancelotti is likely to bring Isco into the starting line-up on Saturday, with the Spain midfielder operating in a central playmaking role alongside James Rodriguez. Second-placed Real are currently two points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona, who host fourth-placed Valencia earlier on Saturday.

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that striker Karim Benzema will miss the La Liga match against Malaga this weekend after the Frenchman suffered a knee injury during last night's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Atletico Madrid.

Benzema, who has scored 15 goals in La Liga this season, limped off midway through the second half of Tuesday's 0-0 draw at the Vicente Calderón and immediately went for a scan on Thursday morning to determine the severity of the injury.

Ancelotti revealed that the injury is not serious but Benzema will definitely miss Saturday's trip to La Rosaleda to face Malaga. The Italy coach also confessed that he took the decision to rest the striker in the absence of any other genuine alternatives. ""It seems that [the injury] is not too serious, but it is an injury and it will keep him out this weekend,"" said the tactician.

""There are no other strikers available, so it seemed the best option to take the risk and leave him out against Atlético,"" he added. As a result, Gonzalo Higuaín could retain his place in the lineup this weekend."," Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti confirmed that striker Karim Benzema will miss the La Liga match against Malaga due to a knee injury suffered during the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Atletico Madrid. | True |

A heartwarming video has gone viral online showing an unexpected act of teamwork between a goat and a donkey. The footage, captured at an animal sanctuary in Arizona, USA, shows a playful goat trying to climb up a tree filled with tasty leaves. To achieve this, the goat places its front feet on the back of its companion donkey and leans forward, balancing precariously on its back legs.

The donkey doesn't move throughout the entire process, allowing the goat to use its weight to balance on its back. After a few minutes, the goat realizes that it can't reach the leaves and backs down, dropping to all fours. The donkey maintains its position and allows the goat to re-engage in the game later.

This unlikely duo have formed a unique bond at the sanctuary, where they live together along with other animals such as pigs, cows, and donkeys. The owner of the sanctuary said that ""fat"" Clyde was particularly interested in the pecan trees at the facility and tried to eat the leaves, which are considered a delicacy among goats.

#####

    * Persistent coughing
    * Sputtering when breathing
    * Frequent lung infections

    * Accumulation of mucus in the lungs

These symptoms may vary depending upon the extent of the damage caused by the disease. However, some people with CF may not have any symptoms in the early stages.

### Causes
#####

    * CF is caused by mutations in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This gene provides the instructions for making a protein that regulates the flow of watery fluids in and out of cells. 
    * Mutations in this gene cause misfolding and degradation of the CFTR protein, leading to blockages in the lungs, pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestines. This results in the buildup of thick, sticky mucus in various organs of the body.
    * The exact cause of CF is not known, but some researchers believe that it may be due to genetic changes or environmental factors.

"'It proved too much too soon for Paris Saint-Germain's David Luiz as the Brazilian was prematurely brought back from injury to replace countryman and captain Thiago Silva in the first half against Barcelona.

Ribery (left) is absent with an ankle injury while Robben is out until May with a stomach muscle tear. 'Of course we have big problems because we have no players for the one-on-one situations.

The reigning Barclays Premier League champions have made the Liverpool forward a primary target this summer as they look to increase their homegrown quota. And the club plan to make a major statement by making a formal offer for the forward at the earliest possible opportunity this summer. Man City are planning a mega-bid to sign Liverpool star Raheem Sterling when the transfer window reopens. Sterling, pictured against Newcastle on Monday night, is a primary target for Manchester City this summer. The transfer window officially opens on July 1, but deals can be discussed between clubs prior to that date. City believe they are leading the race to land Sterling this summer and are confident they can complete what would be one of the biggest transfers this summer. Liverpool value Sterling at around £50million, a fee that City can certain afford. But City will have to be cute in their attempts to land Sterling given the threat of Financial Fair Play sanctions.

"'Reading manager Steve Clarke and his players will rally round goalkeeper Adam Federici to help him get over his Wembley gaffe. The Australian blew his side’s chances of beating Arsenal in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final by spilling Alexis Sanchez’s shot into his own net in extra-time. Federici was inconsolable after the match and Clarke revealed: ‘I tried to hug him but he was very, very disappointed. He just wanted to get inside and have his sad moment by himself. You have to respect that. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Adam Federici in extra time. It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp. The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. ‘When he comes into training we’ll have a little chat but he’ll be fine. He’s a professional.’ The incident was reminiscent of Robert Green’s error in England’s 2010 World Cup opener against the USA, when Clint Dempsey’s strike got through him. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan added of Federici: ‘He’s one of the best goalkeepers around and they all make mistakes. ‘The saves he made earlier were top-class and he was probably man of the match up to that point. Nobody will blame him.’ Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. The Reading goalkeeper left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him. Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper.' ","#####

"'Belgian teenager Obbi Oulare scored as Club Brugge came from behind to beat Anderlecht in front of scouts from a number of Europe’s top clubs. Scouts from Manchester United, Everton, Sunderland, Burnley, Dortmund and Leverkusen were in Belgium to watch the top of the table clash. And Sportsmail understands 19-year-old Oulare was the reason the scouts from England and Germany were in attendance. Club Brugge forward Obbi Oulare holds off a defender during his side's Europa League game last week. Oulare started against Dinpro in midweek and scored against Anderlecht for the Brugge on Sunday. And he did not disappoint as he scored in the 74th minute after a Timmy Simons own goal to put Anderlecht ahead. Ruud Vormer then scored with four minutes remaining to take all three points and extend Club Brugge’s lead at the top of the league to four points. Oulare is the son of former Guinea international Souleymane Oulare and has represented Belgium at Under 18 and 19 level before making his U21 debut against Moldova in March. The young striker came through the youth ranks at Lille, the same academy that has produced the likes of Liverpool loanee Divock Origi and Chelsea star Eden Hazard, also both Belgian. The young striker is being watched by some of Europe's top clubs, including Manchester United. Despite being just 19 years of age, Oulare is a strong forward, and has scored four times this season.' ","##### OBBI OULARE ######

Obbi Oulare is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Club Brugge. He spent time playing for Lille's youth teams before joining their reserve team in 2012. In July 2014, he signed his first professional contract with Lille, which lasted until June 30, 2016.
Oulare made his professional debut with Lille in a 2–1 Coupe de la Ligue loss to Bastia on 16 December 2014. On 31 January 2017, Oulare joined Standard Liège on loan until the end of the season. On 17 August 2018, Oulare joined Charleroi on a five-year deal. Oulare struggled with injuries throughout his time at Charleroi, and despite his recovery, the club opted to loan him to Waasland-Beveren for the 2019–20 season. After one year without a club, Oulare returned to Charleroi in July 2021.
On 22 September 2022, Oulare left Club Brugge by mutual agreement. Five days later, Belgian First Division A club Zulte Waregem announced that they had reached an agreement with Club Brugge for Oulare's transfer.

CONCLUSION

Inter scouted over 20 players during the winter transfer window, selling or loaning out many of them. Only four new players were brought into the club, three of whom were sold or loaned out within a year.

The recruitment policy of new manager Walter Mazzarri was largely unpopular with the club's fans, who called for the dismissal of the Italian. The most high-profile sale of one of their own players in recent times was that of Diego Milito to Genoa.

In the 2012–13 season, Inter signed 10 players and sold 11 players.[46] In the next transfer window, they signed 14 players and sold eight players. The Nerazzurri spent around €160 million on new players, earning them the nickname of ""Il gigante della trasformatoria"" (The transformer giant).[47][48]

Following the appointment of Andrea Stramaccioni as manager, Inter signed several players during the January 2014 transfer window, including Geoffrey Kondogbia, Joao Mario and Esteban Rolón, whilst also selling many players, such as Zbigniew Boniek, Nicola Siri and Hernán Crespo.

"'Nottingham Forest will make a renewed move for Blackburn's £10million-rated striker Jordan Rhodes this summer.

"'The MCC has announced the latest phase of its 'Masterplan' redevelopment of Lord's which includes the replacement of the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands. The intention is to build a single new structure in their place, with more than 5,500 seats, in the south-western corner of the home of cricket - to raise the ground's overall capacity to almost 30,000. MCC is operating to a projected budget of £80million, and hopes work can begin in autumn 2017 - subject to planning permission, consultation with nearby residents and the approval of club members. MCC reveals plans to replace the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands at Lord's, with completion scheduled for 2019. The redevelopment will increase the overall capacity of Lord's, the home of English cricket, to almost 30,000. If the project goes ahead, a new Thomas Lord Building and new Tavern pub will also be included - as well as enlarged dressing rooms in the pavilion and a 'more pedestrian-friendly entrance to the ground', via the Grace Gates. MCC chief executive Derek Brewer said: 'The south-western project will ensure facilities for players, match officials, supporters and MCC members are of the highest possible standard by modernising areas of the ground that have become tired. 'MCC is committed to maintaining Lord's as the finest cricket ground in the world, and this project also provides a wonderful new front door to the home of cricket.' MCC aims to submit a planning application to Westminster City Council this summer. A completion schedule for the new stand is spring 2019, in time for that summer's World Cup and Ashes. It is anticipated the remaining elements of the 'Masterplan' may take a further three years. The 'Masterplan', which has a projected budget of £80million, should be ready for the World Cup and Ashes.' ","#####Header

"'Philippe Coutinho is becoming Liverpool's go-to guy and is picking up where Luis Suarez left off last season, believes Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher. Coutinho starred for Liverpool in their 2-0 win against Newcastle United on Monday night and managed five shots against goalkeeper Tim Krul, though he could not nab himself a goal. Liverpool sold Suarez to Barcelona for £75million during the summer, but Carragher feels Coutinho can fill the sizable gap left by the controversial Uruguay striker. Philippe Coutinho is becoming Liverpool's go-to guy, according to Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher. Coutinho starred for Liverpool in their 2-0 win against Newcastle United on Monday night. Liverpool sold star striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million during the summer. 'The role he played tonight was the false nine we speak about a lot,' Carragher told Sky Sports after the Barclays Premier League match. 'We expect him in a wide area, but we saw some of his touches tonight and his ability in small spaces against players, some of the pieces of play he produced tonight. 'Last season Luis Suarez was Liverpool's main man, the go-to man. But as this season has progressed, and for the future, Coutinho is Liverpool's.' It was Coutinho who scored Liverpool's only goal against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the FA Cup last week to book their place in the semi-final. The Brazil international signed a new five-year contract with Liverpool in February after completing a £8.5m move from Inter Milan in January 2013.

"'Sampdoria have revived their interest in Mario Balotelli should he choose to take a pay cut. Eccentric club president Massimo Ferrero says the talented but frustrating 24-year-old has lost his desire for football and needs to go to Stadio Luigi Ferraris to re-discover himself. Liverpool have been willing to sell Balotelli since January but could find no takers after signing him for £16m. Mario Balotelli has only scored once in the Premier League since his switch to Liverpool last summer. The Italian striker is set to leave the club at the end of the season and Sampdoria want to sign him. The Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero says that Balotelli has lost his hunger. Ferrero said Balotelli should be put on a diet of bread and water and given a Bianchina (a small car from the 1960s) instead of a Ferrari. His agent Mino Raiola has also hinted Liverpool would have to pay him off first after saying he wanted to finish his contract and prove to the Anfield crowd he was good enough. Tentative loan offers have been proposed and Sampdoria would likely offer a cut price permanent move. Ferrero said: 'I’d sign him. If he came to Sampdoria, he would come back to his usual standards. Here nobody would bother him if he missed a goal, he would be quiet and happy.' Talking to Gazzetta TV, Ferrero added: 'In my opinion he’s not hungry anymore, he earns 4 million euros (£2.9m) a year. We should put him on bread and water, give him a Bianchina [a small car from the 1960s] rather than a Ferrari… then I’m sure he would score again.''

'We were not good enough to bring the three points.' When Alberto Gilardino was fouled by Verona keeper Rafael in the 65th minute and the referee pointed to the spot Diamanti stepped up but saw his penalty saved low down by Rafael. With that the Viola began to run out of ideas and Obbadi pounced when home keeper Neto failed to gather a shot from Lazaros Christodoulopoulos.

"'Manchester City have emerged as the biggest threat to Arsenal in the race for Charlton’s highly-rated defender Joe Gomez. The England Under-19 defender, valued at £8m by the Championship team, is one of the most wanted young players in the country after his breakthrough season at The Valley. City, beaten 3-1 by Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final on Monday evening, are determined to sign more young English players. Joe Gomez has played at right back for Charlton this season and is wanted by Manchester City and Arsenal. Gomez has emerged as a key talent in the England junior set up, but his rapid progress at first team level with Charlton has alerted City. He has been earmarked to play centre half in the future, but he initially broke into the Charlton side at right back. Gomez, 17, signed a three year contract at Charlton in November last year, but the Addicks face a battle to hold on to their rising star in the summer.

"'Juventus defender Patrice Evra has revealed that Sir Alex Ferguson told him he would make a great coach one day during his time at Manchester United. The French left back, 33, enjoyed eight years at Old Trafford, claiming five Premier League titles as well as a Champions League winners' medal. And Evra says that before the legendary Scottish boss left in 2013 he told him, as well as Ryan Giggs, that he had the potential to become a fine manager. Former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra says Sir Alex Ferguson told him he would be a great coach. Evra is now at Juventus but says he has already taken some of his coaching badges. Giggs is currently Louis van Gaal's assistant at Man United, while Evra says he got passed some of his coaching badges before leaving for Juventus on a free last summer. 'Before he left, Ferguson called me into his office,' the Frenchman told Canal Plus. 'He said to me, 'Pat, I'm going to tell you something very important. There are two players in this team that are going to become great trainers: Ryan Giggs and you.' 'So, I got some of my coaching credentials while still in Manchester. Now I want to get my coaching diploma and then we'll see.' Evra left Manchester United on a free transfer in 2014 after eight years at the club.' ","#####

The above text is a summarized version of an interview with Patrice Evra about his time playing for Manchester United. According to the article, before Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, he told Evra and Ryan Giggs that they had the potential to become good coaches. This was an unexpected compliment for the players, who were known for their skills on the field rather than their technical knowledge of the game.

After his retirement from football, Evra took some coaching courses and became a youth coach. He believes that Sir Alex's prediction has come true, and that he too has the potential to become a successful coach in the future.

Sir Alex Ferguson's prediction that Patrice Evra and Ryan Giggs had the potential to become good managers proved correct. Both former players have gone on to success in different fields.

"'Wildlife officials in Alaska are going to kill a mother bear and her four cubs after the family started eating out from trash cans in a busy neighborhood. The black bears were spotted in the Government Hill area of Anchorage several days in a row, nosing through overturned receptacles and putting the neighborhood on alert. Residents were warned to keep their distance and make sure pets stayed on a leash in light of the hungry predators. Scroll down for video. Execution planned: Wildlife authorities in Anchorage, Alaska, said they will kill this family of a mother bear and her four children after they starting eating from trash cans in the area. Officials with Alaska's Department of Fish and Game ruled Thursday that killing the family was the only option as once they develop a taste for trash they are likely to return even if moved. According to the Alaska Dispatch News, the mother bear was seen huffing and looking 'defensive' on Thursday after residents started taking cell phone pictures of the animals. They eventually climbed a tree to flee, but are still likely to cause trouble in the area. The local council has suggested buying in bear-proof garbage cans in a bid to stop more bears moving in on the area. Officials did not give an exact time when they would move in and kill the bears, but a Twitter account for Government Hill's council said the deed would be done 'in the next few days'.

"'Southend United's promotion charge continued on Tuesday night  at Bury when a David Worrall free-kick enabled them to leapfrog their hosts into fourth place. Former Bury player Worrall struck from 25 yards in the 74th minute with a superb curling effort  from a set-piece courtesy of a yellow-carded foul by Adam El-Abd. It put manager Phil Brown’s late-goal specialists, who pinched an added-time winner at Exeter on Saturday, behind third-placed Wycombe only on goal difference. Phil Brown's Southend United move into fourth after a 1-0 win over Bury on Tuesday night. While Bury dominated for long spells, Brown’s men were rarely in trouble.

They were backed by one of their biggest crowds of the season - 8,396 - having offered free entry after the initial fixture was postponed. Less than 10 minutes was played of the first attempt at the match in March but the open gates saw the club enjoy its biggest home crowd for almost 18 years.

```
Ruby Walsh is renowned as one of the greatest jockeys of all time but he also showed what a fine horseman he is by helping to rescue a fallen rider during a race.
Walsh, who has won more than 3,000 races in a career spanning three decades, helped prevent other horses from being injured when he quickly leapt off his own horse, Ballycasey, after falling victim to another horse's injury.
The incident occurred on the second lap of the famous Aintree racecourse during the 2017 Grand National.
After clearing the final fence, the 30-year-old Irish rider fell after attempting to avoid another horse which had unseated its rider.
It was later discovered that the horse which had unseated had in fact fractured its shoulder, however both Walsh and his fellow rider, 44-year-old Noel Fehily, were unharmed.
Hobbs, whose horse Balthazar King had also fallen victim to the accident, described Walsh as ""one of the great horsemen"".

Walcott, pictured arriving at Turf Moor on Saturday, has struggled for playing time so far this season. The England winger has attracted interest from Premier League duo Manchester City and Liverpool.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers views Walcott as a potential replacement for Raheem Sterling, whose future at Anfield is unclear. Walcott will wait to discover how he fits into Wenger's plans before making a decision on his future. He has been a peripheral figure this season and wants to be playing regularly at the age of 26.

"'A protective dad has devised a creative way to keep the boys away from his young daughter - by printing his muscly torso on a t-shirt and making her wear it. 'Stay Clear Boys,' a message on the shirt warns. 'This is my dad!' And while his daughter doesn't look too happy about the new attire, her father is pictured grinning beside her. The image was first shared on Reddit under the headline 'Dad security' at the weekend. A dad created this t-shirt to keep the boys away from his daughter - and she doesn't look happy about it. Kit Dale, a two-time World Pro Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu champion from Melbourne, Australia, shared the image to his Facebook page on Sunday, writing: 'Hahahha smart dad.' By Wednesday, the image on his page had been liked by 370,000 Facebook users and had been shared more than 45,000 times. While some commenters both applauded the move - and even asked whether the girl was in need of a step-mother - others ridiculed it. 'Dads thought process: How can I tell more people I work out, and not look like a tool?' one wrote.

1. Don't Drink Canal Water - It can contain dangerous pathogens from human waste and other sources. Until laboratories develop a way to clean canals, don't drink from them.
2. Rainwater is usually safe to drink, if it hasn't collected dirt and other pollutants while falling. Always use a water filter or purification tablet before drinking rainwater.
3. Many communities get water directly from rivers and lakes, which could be contaminated with bacteria and parasites. Only drink lake or river water that you know to be safe or after using a filtration device like a boiling process or a water filter.
4. Wells often provide the safest water, but wells can contain contaminants from soil, animals, and humans. Therefore, always use a well water filter or treatment device.
5. Bottled waters are usually safe to drink, but check the country of origin for any recent reports of contamination. If the report is related to a pathogen, don't drink that bottled water.

As Mr Bell tended the victim – Alan Tretheway, 67 – he was struck by a Toyota driven by mother-of-three Iram Shahzad.' ","	A retired police officer helping a stranded motorist on the M1 motorway was tragically struck and killed by a speeding car.

Mrs Shahzad, who was driving a Toyota SUV, admitted to driving dangerously on the motorway and causing the death of 71-year old Spencer Bell.

Bell, who was wearing reflective clothing and using a mobile phone while helping the man on the hard shoulder, was unfortunately standing in front of an exit ramp when he was hit by Mrs Shahzad's vehicle.

The court heard how Mrs Shahzad, who was driving at speeds between 76 mph and 87 mph, failed to slow down or steer clear of Bell who was standing just 50 feet ahead.

Spencer Bell, a father-of-two and grandfather-of-five, was pronounced dead at the scene.

"'Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey has slammed the FA’s decision to put Jon Moss in charge of the FA Cup final instead of Mark Clattenburg. Halsey said the English game would be a ‘laughing stock’ over the decision to ignore Clattenburg, one of only two English referees in the UEFA elite ranks — for the final between Aston Villa and Arsenal on May 30. ‘Greg Dyke (Chairman of the FA) has got to look at the appointment process for the FA Cup referee because, frankly, it’s a joke,’ said Halsey. Mark Halsey has slammed the decision to overlook Mark Clattenburg (above) for the FA Cup final on May 30. Former Premier League referee Halsey (middle) has  called the Football Association's decision 'a joke' ‘I don’t blame Jon Moss. But is he the best man for the job? Absolutely not. ‘It’s clear Mark Clattenburg should be in charge. He’s consistently our outstanding referee who proves himself on the biggest stage.’ Halsey thinks Clattenburg, who has never refereed an FA Cup final, has been overlooked as The Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMO) would prefer Martin Atkinson to go to Euro 2016 next summer. ‘We’ll be a laughing stock around the world,’ Halsey wrote on sports networking site Kicca. ‘I don’t think the hierarchy want Clattenburg to go the European Championship next summer. This is their way of sending out a message to UEFA that Clattenburg isn’t our top ref.’ Halsey also said the English game would be a ‘laughing stock’ over the decision to ignore Clattenburg. Jon Moss will take charge of FA Cup final at Wembley between Arsenal and Aston Villa.' ","#####

"'Tim Sherwood's penchant for a gilet has put the Aston Villa boss' sense of fashion in the spotlight and it isn't hard to imagine what he thought about Carles N'Zogbia's choice of attire on Tuesday. The Villa wide man turned up for training at the club's Bodymoor Heath complex wearing an outrageously flamboyant shirt and trouser combo. Shay Given certainly wasn't a fan of N'Zogbia's flowery ensemble, made worse by his decision to wear sunglasses in the dressing room. Charles N'Zogbia poses in his flowery outfit before Aston Villa training on Tuesday. N'Zogbia has featured regularly under Tim Sherwood since his appointment in February. N'Zogbia is no stranger to a garish outfit as seen here in a camouflage jump suit. Tim Sherwood became famous for wearing a gilet during his time as Tottenham manager last season. The Aston Villa goalkeeper took to Twitter to ridicule the Frenchman's choice of attire describing it as the 'the worst ever'. The Ireland international posted a picture of N'Zogbia on the social networking site writing 'OMG get on Charles N'Zogbia's gear. #wow #Worstever'. N'Zogbia has featured regularly under Sherwood since he was appointed in February, but after catching a glimpse of his outfit may have had a few choice words for the former Newcastle man.

"'Floyd Mayweather lacks class and does not act in the manner befitting a champion, according to Marvin Hagler.

Floyd Mayweather performs at a media workout with his uncle Roger on the pads in Las Vegas. Mayweather is not shy when it comes to sharing pictures of his wealth on social media. Mayweather has posted pictures of himself counting money and of his expensive timepiece. Hagler, speaking at the Laureus Sports Awards on the 30th anniversary of his blockbuster fight with Thomas Hearns, said he is in danger of alienating fans. 'It's not class and really no way for a champion to act,' he said. 'If you have the skills you don't need to impress everybody by being a show-off. Then when you get beat, the public stays behind the winner instead of with you when you were the champion.' Hagler's fight with Hearns is widely considered to be one of the finest bouts in history but he warned Mayweather's £$300million showdown with Manny Pacquiao could be a dud. The two best pound-for-pound fighters will finally meet in Las Vegas on May 2. 'Mayweather can put you to sleep,' Hagler added. 'Just by boxing and moving around and no excitement and Manny could be more on the defensive side rather than the offensive side so it might be boring.'

"'Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge was left in stitches by an impersonation of club legend Michael Owen. Ahead of the Reds' FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday, the England international met up with comedian Darren Farley as part of an exclusive promotional video to showcase the TV coverage of the match by BT Sport. Farley, who first rose to prominence on YouTube, specialises in mimicking a number of Anfield stars both past and present. Daniel Sturridge cannot stop laughing after hearing Darren Farley's impression of Michael Owen. Owen, now a BT Sport pundit, played for Liverpool between 1996 and 2004, scoring 118 league goals. His hauntingly accurate of portrayal of Owen was certainly one of his best performances and had Sturridge gasping for breath. Between the giggles, the pair discussed the fascinating clash with Villa and Sturridge's trademark goal celebration dance. However, while Farley's Owen impression was certainly on point, his dancing left a lot to be desired. Sturridge is a major doubt to feature in the game with Villa, facing a late battle to overcome a hip injury. Villa, meanwhile, have their own concerns with winger Gabriel Agbonlahor rated 'touch and go' in relation to a hamstring strain, while midfielder Carlos Sanchez is suspended. The other FA Cup semi-final will be played between Arsenal and Reading on Saturday. Sturridge shakes hands with talented comedian Farley as part of a promotional video for BT Sport. Farley sets off on his Owen impression and it isn't long before Sturridge starts to smirk. The Liverpool hitman cannot help but burst into a fit of laughter as Farley watches on. Sturridge struggles to get his words out as Farley delivers a very accurate impression of Owen.' ","##### SPOILER ALERT ##### When asked about the upcoming football match between Liverpool and Aston Martin, Daniel Sturridge says that he is not going to watch the live broadcast of the game because he does not want to see his team lose. He also mentions that he prefers to watch basketball instead. This statement raises some eyebrows among his teammates, especially Jamie Carragher. After all, Liverpool has a good chance of winning the Premier League this season. However, Michael Owen suddenly appears and tells Daniel that he has arranged a surprise for him. When Daniel arrives at the location, he finds himself in a mockumentary-style film set where Owen is playing himself. Additionally, various actors are portraying different characters, such as Rio Ferdinand, Steven Gerrard, Jermain Defoe, and more. They are all participating in a comedy sketch about how bad their impersonations of Daniel Sturridge are. The entire scene is incredibly meta and hilarious, especially since the actors are exaggerating their accents and mannerisms to the point of absurdity. Furthermore, Owen continuously reminds everyone that his impersonation is better than theirs, which only adds to the humour.

A champion jockey competing in the first race of a meeting in Sydney suffered a rather unfortunate incident during the race—his pants ripped, revealing his bare bottom to everyone.

This YouTuber managed to film their son chasing their cat around the garden in order to get some rest. However, the cat was not willing to give the son the rest he desired, and continued to play with the son until he got tired and fell asleep. This YouTuber seems to be quite playful, because after the son fell asleep, they repeated the same thing, trying to get some rest themselves. However, the son continued to nap until he finally gave up, which seemed to have worked out for the son, since he woke up the next day without any problems. It is good that the son was able to fall asleep where he wanted, but it is also interesting to see how cats think and behave.

"'Whoever snatched a seal or sea lion pup from a Los Angeles beach early Sunday should not confuse the animal's cuteness with its potentially vicious bite, according to an animal rescue expert. Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup in a blanket and left in a car around 3:20 a.m. from Dockweiler State Beach, just west of the city's international airport, said Los Angeles Police Officer Rosario Herrera. The initial police report said the animal was a small seal. Marine Animal Rescue managed to save another young sea lion shortly after the animal escaped several people said to be harassing it. Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup (not pictured) in a blanket and left in a car around  from Dockweiler State Beach. But a companion pup that escaped and was later found on the beach is a sea lion, according to Peter Wallerstein, the president of the group Marine Animal Rescue. The rescued pup weighs about 25 pounds and is probably 10 months old, said Wallerstein, who stays in a trailer at the beach and was woken by security guards seeking his help. Sea lions of this size are 'really small, really look cute, but they're dangerous,' he said. 'These are wild animals.' They're also not fit to be kept as pets. Though small pups are cute they can be very dangerous, officials warned. 'The animal needs fluids, needs special treatments,' he said. 'You can't just feed it dog food. It's not going to work.'

"'Israel is developing a system to accurately detect tunnelling activity, it has been revealed. The 'first of its kind' equipment, developed by Elbit Systems working with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, will be able to detect activity at a distance using a series of sensors. These sensors were so precise there would be 'no false alarms'. The decision comes after the Israeli army considered more than 700 proposals aimed at combating a tunnel threat. Israel is developing a system to accurately detect tunnelling activity, it has been revealed. Above, an Israeli soldier inspects a tunnel in August 2014. It is thought the system will cost around £2.3million ($3.5m) per mile to install. A proposed area to introduce it is along the land border between Gaza and Israel, officials said. Alon Shuster, head of Sha’ar Hanegev regional council, told The Times of Israel the move would be welcomed by residents. He said: 'This advancement provides an additional layer of security.' The exact time-frame of the project has not been made clear, although it has been reported it will take around a year to install. It comes after years of fighting between Israel and Gaza. It is thought the system will cost around £2.3million ($3.5m) per mile to install. Above, Palestinian men look at what used to be a tunnel. Israeli military spokesmen have previously said the aim of some of their attacks was to destroy cross-border tunnels, which are usually around one metre wide and 2.5 metres tall. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated the concern about tunnels in August 2014 and said soldiers were completing 'neutralisation' of the underground network. The new system has successfully passed initial tests. More results will be available in the next few months, officials added.' ","##########TUTORIAL UNBOXING THREADS#####

**Abstract:**
This paper presents an overview of the current methods used for denoising and super-resolving images degraded by different types of noise. Denoising is the process of removing noise from an image, while super-resolution refers to the task of producing a high resolution image from multiple low resolution images captured by a camera with a limited aperture. Noise can occur due to various factors such as sensor noise, photon noise, electronic noise, and background noise. It is important to remove noise from images to obtain a clearer and more accurate representation of the original image. This is especially true in medical imaging, where the quality of the images plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the diagnosis. Different types of noise can include shot noise, thermal noise, radio frequency interference (RFI), flicker noise, and dark current noise. Denoising algorithms can use different techniques such as filtering, wavelet decomposition, regularization, and gradient based methods. Super-resolution algorithms can be classified into two main categories: sparse-view SR (SVSR) and non-sparse-view SR (N SVSR). These algorithms typically involve capturing multiple images of the object from different angles, and using these images to estimate the image geometry and calculate the final image."," Denoising is the process of removing noise from an image. | False |

Professor John Warren discovered avocado trees switch from male to female in a matter of hours. The flowers close for the night and then the next morning they reopen - but now they use their 'male anthers' to spread their pollen.

'The trees are usually successful in avoiding the 'sin' of inbreeding.' Professor Warren has written about the avocado in his book called the Nature of Crops.

"'A piano teacher awaiting a jury's verdict on charges claiming he sexually assaulted an underage student has shot himself outside a New Hampshire courthouse, court officials say. Authorities say 75-year-old John Goodwin, of Atkinson, went on trial this week on six counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. Prosecutors said that Atkinson, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted a student, who is now 24 years old, according to SeaCoastOnline. John Goodwin, 75, shot himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student. The former student testified he didn't come forward until 2013 because he was embarrassed, according to WMUR. The station reports Goodwin's lawyer acknowledged his client was 'touchy-feely,' but he didn't commit a crime. Court officials say the jury was deliberating when Goodwin shot himself late Friday morning near his car in a parking lot outside Rockingham County Superior Courthouse. He wasn't in custody. Court officials say Goodwin was airlifted to a hospital with life-threatening injuries from the self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to WPTZ. His health status has not been immediately disclosed. As of Friday afternoon, jurors were still deliberating, but court officials would not say if the jurors knew about the shooting. The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office is expected to release more information about the incident Friday evening. Goodwin was by his car outside Rockingham County Courthouse in New Hampshire when he shot himself. He was not in custody at the time and his health status has not been disclosed, though he was airlifted to hospita.' ","##### #####

He took the footage with his friend Ricky Bailey while the two were out in a tractor on Wednesday evening. Scroll down for video. Vortex: Stan Cole, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, filmed this landspout from just 100 yards away in Loraine, Texas.

He said: 'Perhaps 10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, my danger meter needs to be recalibrated'. Landspouts - the scientific term for tornadoes which are not part of a thunderstorm - can be difficult to capture on film. The wind formations tend not to last much longer than 15 minutes, and are too small-scale to appear on weather radars. Other landspout photographs emerged Wednesday night from the area around Loraine.

"'Manchester United have identified Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan as the leading contender to fill Michael Carrick's midfield role. United are eyeing a £20.5million deal for the central midfielder, and reports emanating from Germany on Friday indicated a deal is now close - though those claims were later denied. United will seek to sign Carrick's successor this summer as part of another huge spending frenzy. Manchester United are closing in on a deal to sign Borussia Dortmund ace Ilkay Gundogan. Gundogan vies for the ball with Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal in the Champions League. Dortmund's ball-playing midfielder Gundogan has been watched extensively by United and has emerged as their primary target. Van Gaal has an intrinsic knowledge of the Bundesliga and believes the 24-year-old has the ability to take over from Carrick on a long-term basis. Carrick, who recently signed a new 12 month extension, will continue to be part of Van Gaal's plans next season - but the club are planning for life without him. Louis van Gaal believes the midfielder is the perfect replacement for current midfielder Michael Carrick. Van Gaal has been hugely impressed with Carrick's contribution at Old Trafford this season. The England international's passing range and ability to dictate the pace of a match has been a key feature for United this season. But at the age of 33, the Dutchman knows the midfielder is in the twilight of his career, while the amount of time Carrick has spent injured this season is also a worry. Gundogan vies for the ball with Hannover ace Horoshi Kiyotake at Signal Iduna Park.' ","##### CHATBOT MARKETING IN ACTION #####

Division of labour: Men do just two hours of housework a day while working, which increases to 3.9 after they retire - but it is still far less than the amount carried out by their stay-at-home wives. The study, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, found women who did not work did an average of 6.8 hours before their husband's retired. Chores included doing the laundry and the washing up, as well as running errands, according to New York Magazine. However, the number of hours they did each day only dropped to 6.1 after their husbands retired. What's more, it seems the men were still avoiding the washing up, even post-retirement. The research noted the increase in the men's hours was mainly taken up by more 'manly' chores - like repairs and gardening. However, the study - conducted by Thomas Leopold at the University of Amsterdam and Jan Skopek at the European University Institute - does not reveal how the burden was shared when both the husband and wife were working.

Jose Mourinho relished the pre-match press conference for Sunday’s Premier League clash between Arsenal and Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium in north London. The Portuguese manager views the pre-match press conference as his opportunity to engage in a battle of wits with the journalists present, and he often uses it to set the tone for the upcoming match.

For this particular press conference, Mourinho opted for a more playful approach, poking fun at the media and teasing them about their questions. He referred to the conference as “a battlefield” and claimed that the journalists present were “not warriors enough.” He also praised one journalist’s question before receiving a query of his own, which prompted more laughter from both Mourinho and the room.

However, Mourinho’s playful attitude soon turned serious when he was asked about his reported rivalry with Arsène Wenger, the former Arsenal manager. Mourinho admitted that there was some truth to the rumours of a feud between the two managers, but he downplayed their rivalry and instead credited Wenger with helping to shape him as a manager.

"'Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew insists he is not interested in raiding former club Newcastle for Tim Krul and is disappointed that reports emerged suggesting he was planning a move. Pardew is planning a busy summer in the transfer market after taking over at Palace and leading the team on an incredible run of form that has pulled them away from the relegation zone. The 53-year-old made the shock decision to leave Newcastle for the south London club in January but maintains that he is happy with current No 1 Julian Speroni. Alan Pardew admits he is disappointed to be linked with a raid on his former club for goalkeeper Tim Krul. Pardew says that as Crystal Palace manager, he has had no contact with Newcastle or Krul over a transfer. The Crystal Palace manager insists he is happy with current Eagles No 1 goalkeeper Julian Speroni. ‘There’s been no contact between me, Newcastle, the player and the agent,’ Pardew said. ‘I’m surprised at that. It’s unwelcome. I’ve got a great relationship with my goalkeeper here. I’m confident that Krul will stay at Newcastle. ‘We’re looking at a number of players for the future but not a goalkeeper at the moment. We need to take the next step. We’re fortunate of the location we have and the crowd we get.

CONCLUSION #####
Pardew's management style and achievements while at West Ham United gained him considerable attention from other clubs. In 2010, after two years of trying, West Ham finally achieved compensation from FIFA for Portsmouth's breach of contract by poaching their manager Harry Redknapp.[5] Pardew signed a new four-year contract with West Ham in July 2009,[6] and guided the club to a record Premier League points total in the 2009–10 season. However, West Ham finished 17th and were relegated to the Championship at the end of the campaign. After winning the promotion playoff final against Reading F.C., Pardew became the first manager in 65 years to regain promotion to the top tier of English football twice with different clubs.
In the 2012–13 Championship, Pardew led Crystal Palace to promotion to the Premier League, where they remained throughout the rest of the 21st century. On 14 June 2015, he left the club after rejecting a new contract.[7]
On 2 December 2015, Pardew was appointed as the new head coach of French Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain, signing a contract until 30 June 2018.[8] He left the club by ""mutual agreement"""," Pardew's management style and achievements at West Ham United gained him attention from other clubs. | False |

"'Arsenal are having reservations over their interest in Raheem Sterling following the Liverpool forward's turbulent few weeks. The Gunners are keen on the Reds forward, who is stalling on a new £100,000-per-week contract at Anfield. But it is understood the 20-year-old's tempestuous fortnight has not gone unnoticed by members of the Emirates Stadium hierarchy. Arsenal may pull out of the running to sign Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling following recent events. Brendan Rodgers has backed his wayward star but contract stand-off has created tension at Liverpool. Sterling's decision to hold his now infamous BBC interview without Liverpool's permission is said to have surprised those at north London. Likewise, the fact he has been caught smoking shisha and inhaling nitrous oxide has not gone down well at Arsenal. And the FA Cup holders are now having second thoughts over their interest in the England international fearing similar scenarios could tarnish the club's reputation.

"'Adrian Peterson is to meet with the NFL to discuss his reinstatement. The Minnesota Vikings running back played once last season before being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list due to a child abuse case. The 30-year-old was was due to be reinstated on April 15, but according to NFL media insider Ian Rapoport, Peterson will meet with the NFL this week. Peterson's situation is far from clear, with the 2012 MVP telling ESPN he was 'uneasy' about returning to the franchise. Adrian Peterson has plenty to chew over but the Minnesota Vikings do not want to trade their star back. It has been a turbulent seven months for Peterson, who has been linked with the Cowboys and Cardinals. His main bone of contention  is said to be with chief operating officer Kevin Warren, whom the Peterson camp claims attempted to keep him off the field last year. The Vikings start offseason workouts in a fortnight and head coach Mike Zimmer has repeatedly spoken of his desire for Peterson to stay. 'I'm not going to speculate on what he wants or doesn't want,' Zimmer said last month. 'Adrian's under contract for three more years with us, and that's why you sign those contracts. That's why you get these big bonuses, you know?' 'We have no plans to trade Adrian,' he said, definitively. Peterson is under contract for 2015, and is set to earn a base salary of $12.75million from the Vikings. The Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals are repeatedly linked as potential landing spots and when his status is settled, it will be one step nearer to finding out where his future lies.'

"'The NFL is set to hire Sarah Thomas as its first permanent female official for regular season games, according to reports. The 42-year-old mother-of-three from Mississippi has officiated pre-season games as a line judge. The Baltimore Sun's Aaron Wilson broke the story, with the NFL refusing to confirm the appointment. The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas will be one of eight new officials for the 2015 season. Sarah Thomas is set to become the NFL's first full-time female official after refereeing college games. Thomas was on the NFL's list of officiating prospects and is set to be named as one of eight new officials. Thomas has a history of trailblazing since beginning her refereeing career in 1999. Starting at high school level, she would go on to become the first woman to referee in a Big Ten stadium and a bowl game. 'She has the right temperament and attitude and feel for the game,' a source told The Baltimore Sun. 'She knows the rules and understands how to apply them in the spirit of the rules. That sets her apart, male or female.' 'I set out to do this and get involved in officiating not having any idea that there were not any females officiating football,' Thomas told NFL Network. 'Being a former basketball player, you saw female officiating all the time. So, no, I don't feel like a pioneer.' In 2012, Shannon Eastin was hired during an officiating lockout and was line judge during the regular season game between the Green Bay Packers and the St Louis Rams. She was not hired permanently, however.'

"'Boxing fans hoping to attend the weigh-in for the welterweight showdown between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao on May 2 must buy advance tickets. The vast numbers expected to attend the eve-of-fight ritual at the MGM Grand Garden Arena has prompted fight organisers to take the step of charging for entry to the event. Tickets will cost £6.60 and will go on sale through MGM Resorts call centre and box office on Friday at 8pm with all funds raised going to the charities chosen by Mayweather and Pacquiao - Susan G. Komen and the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. Floyd Maywetaher is looking to make it 49-0 with a win against the hard-hitting Filipino fighter. 'The weigh-in is always the grand finale of fight week activities,' said Mayweather Promotions chief executive Leonard Ellerbe. 'And with the massive interest in this fight, the number of fans looking to attend the official weigh-in is going to be something we've never seen before. 'We're excited to be able to use the enthusiasm around this event to provide donations to two very deserving charities.' Manny Pacquiao has wanted this fight for years and will be the toughest opponent that Mayweather has faced. A mere 500 tickets were made available to the public for the clash between the two best fighters of their generation. These sold out in minutes with resale prices on secondary seller StubHub ranging from £3,900 to £85,000 on Friday morning. Concerned by the prospect of mass attendance at the weigh-in by the hundreds of thousands of fans expected to descend on Las Vegas for fight weekend, organisers opted to charge for seats, which will be allocated. The American and his opponent are preparing for the biggest and lucrative fight in the sports history.' ","##### Weight-Control Diet###

Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao have trained extremely hard to get into fighting shape. To keep up their physical fitness during the five-week lead-up to the fight, they've followed special diets created by their nutritionists. Here's a look at what each fighter has been consuming before the big bout:

    Mayweather: Because he's a counterpuncher at heart, Mayweather has stuck to a low-carb diet rich in protein and other nutrient-dense foods. His carbohydrate intake has been kept below 100 grams per day, and he's been eating plenty of lean proteins such as chicken, fish, and beef. For dessert, Mayweather has been enjoying fruits like strawberries, blueberries, apples, and oranges. According to his trainer, Mayweather hasn't touched a candy bar since January 2015.

    Pacquiao: In order to gain maximum weight for the fight, Pacquiao has been taking in approximately 420 grams of carbohydrates per day. His primary source of carbohydrates has been brown rice, which provides slowly digestible carbs that release energy over an extended period.

"'Conor McGregor has claimed he would 'kill' Floyd Mayweather 'in less than 30 seconds' if he was ever pitted against the best boxer in the world. McGregor, who is preparing for his world title fight against UFC featherweight champion Jose Aldo in July, said Mayweather lacked the skills in areas other than boxing. 'I don't look at a man who's expert in one area as a specialist,' he told Esquire. 'I look at him as a rookie in ten other areas. If you can box, what happens if I grab hold of your legs? Conor McGregor, posing here with his new tattoo, has said he would beat Floyd Mayweather with ease. 'If you put me face-to-face with Floyd Mayweather - pound-for-pound boxing's best - if I fought Floyd, I would kill him in less than thirty seconds. 'It would take me less than thirty seconds to wrap around him like a boa constrictor and strangle him.' McGregor has won all five of his fights in the UFC to earn himself a shot at Aldo while Mayweather takes on long-time rival Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand venue on May 2. The most famous boxer to make the move to mixed martial arts is former world champion James Toney who fought Randy Couture in 2010. Toney lasted just over three minutes before he tapped out having been taking to the canvas in the opening seconds. Another former champion, Roy Jones Jnr, has repeatedly called for a fight against Anderson Silva, considered the greatest mixed martial artist of all times. Mayweather is currently in training for his $300m mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao next month. James Toney lost in the first round when he took on Randy Couture in the UFC in 2010.'

"'Bubba Watson is used to wowing spectators with unorthodox golf shots on the course, but the two-time Masters champion has proved he can go one step further in practice. The 36-year-old took to Twitter on Saturday to show fans a new trick he had been working on. Working with his caddie in China, Watson pulled off a baseball-style shot with a driver, striking the ball as it was dropped from a height. Bubba Watson showed off an incredible baseball style trick shot while practicing in China. The American flicked the ball to someone in the tree before they dropped it and he smashed it down the middle. And he didn't just trickle it down the fairway, either. Watson's shot seemed to fly down the middle, drawing quite a reaction from his caddie. Watson struggled for form at the Shenzhen International, finishing T-29 at the European Tour event. The American did however, recover after two opening rounds of 74 with a 65 on the final day. Watson finished T-38 at the Masters, despite being one of the favourites to seal a third green jacket in four years. The ball flew straight down the middle, much to the excitement of his friend behind the camera. Watson's form has been poor in recent weeks after a disappointing Masters and Shenzen International.'

This will make it easier for you to remember this new information in the future.

• Pay attention to details during the learning process, and try to understand the underlying meaning of what you are studying. This will help you remember important facts and concepts in the long run.

• Create mnemonic devices such as acronyms or rhymes to aid memory. For example, to remember the order of the planets in the solar system, you could think of them as characters in a story (such as the characters in ""The Little Prince""). By associating the names of the planets with memorable characters, you'll find it easier to recall their correct order.

• Practice spaced repetition, which involves spreading out the time between revisiting a piece of information. This makes it more likely that the information will be remembered eventually.

• Consider using a study tool like Anki, which is a spaced repetition deck that allows you to organize information into categories. Anki remembers where you left off if you stop listening to a lecture mid-sentence, so you don't have to keep repeating yourself.

"'Ronnie O’Sullivan urged Britain’s shoemakers to spare him Crucible agony after getting through three pairs in a chaotic start to his Betfred World Snooker Championship campaign. The five-time former champion was a 10-3 winner against Craig Steadman, a 32-year-old from Manchester who endured a painful Crucible debut. O’Sullivan was hurting, too, after earning his last-16 place — due to the discomfort his shoes were causing him. Ronnie O'Sullivan moved into the second round of the World Snooker Championship on Wednesday. The five-time world champion beat Craig Steadman 10-3 in their first round contest at The Crucible. He might have faced a fine of around £250 for briefly playing on without shoes, but because O’Sullivan was ready to accept any other pair of size eights offered his way, tournament officials decided there was no case of a dress-code breach to answer. The title favourite dug out an old pair of dress shoes for yesterday’s play, as he converted a 7-2 overnight lead, before putting out a call for help. ‘If any top shoemakers feel like they want to come and sort me out with a new pair, send your boys down. I’m not going to say no,’ said O’Sullivan. ‘I’d appreciate a new pair of shoes and I need some help.’ O’Sullivan will face Matthew Stevens in the second round after he beat fellow Welshman Mark Williams 10-2. O'Sullivan led 7-2 overnight and returned on Wednesday morning to win the final three frames he needed. O'Sullivan won by a comprehensive margin but didn't hit top form during his first round match. The 39-year-old had trouble with his shoes during the session on Tuesday afternoon. O'Sullivan was seen playing in socks on Tuesday and could face a small fine for breach of dress code.' ","##### Human: ##### Sure, here's a brief summary of the text:

""Ronnie O'Sullivan, one of snooker's most celebrated players, was forced to wear three different pairs of shoes during his first round match at this year's World Snooker Championship. This is because the shoes he usually wears are too tight and uncomfortable, which causes him pain when he plays. Despite this, O'Sullivan still managed to win his match against Craig Steadman convincingly, taking the first round match 10-3.
In addition to his shoes problem, O'Sullivan also complained that his rack was ""confusing"" him. However, he eventually found his rhythm and converted several tricky shots to move ahead.
Overall, despite some early difficulties, O'Sullivan managed to prevail over his opponent and advance to the next round of the competition. He now faces Matthew Stevens, a player he has a good record against in the past.
It's worth noting that while O'Sullivan may have worn different shoes during the match, he did comply with the regulations regarding dress code. It remains to be seen whether he will be subject to any disciplinary action for his shoe choices.""

And now the Spurs striker features in a clever new animation, which features some of Kane's best goals, and celebrations from the season. Harry Kane celebrates yet another goal during what has been an incredible season for the young striker. Kane scores past Tim Krul for Spurs against Newcastle, his 20th Premier League goal of the season. The video, produced by Copa90, uses still photographs of the England forward placed one on top of the other to produce an animated effect. It features his long-range strike against Chelsea, a headed goal against Arsenal, and the moment he came on - and scored - on his England debut. The video is entitled 'Harry Kane - PFA Player of the Year?' and has been released ahead of the awards ceremony on Sunday, where Kane is up against the likes of Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez for the top prize.

"'The Rangers board have held their first meeting with Mike Ashley since assuming control at Ibrox. Interim chairman Paul Murray and director John Gilligan held talks with Ashley and other members of the Sports Direct hierarchy on Wednesday. While no details of the discussions have been disclosed, supporters will hope it may represent an initial step towards finding an amicable way forward with the billionaire owner of Newcastle United. Controversial Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has secured an 8.92 stake in Rangers. Murray, Gilligan and Dave King ousted Ashley allies Derek Llambias and Barry Leach from the Ibrox board at an EGM on March 6 and have since spent time studying all the club's existing contracts and commercial arrangements. Sports Direct loaned the previous Rangers regime £5million in January, receiving security over various assets – including club trademarks – in return. They also have the right, yet to be exercised, to appoint two directors to the board. That deal also saw Ashley's firm take a 75 per cent grip of the Rangers Retail subsidiary, increasing their stranglehold over merchandising income. The new Ibrox board last month revealed they would not be drawing down the second £5 million available from Sports Direct, instead accepting a £1.5 million loan from the Three Bears consortium for short-term financing while they formulate a longer-term funding plan.

'I want someone to say that they want Yaya to stay at Manchester City. Yaya is a legend at the club. All the supporters like him, he's helped them make history.'

Gomis' injury has come at the worst possible time as he was finding his best form in a Swansea shirt after a difficult first season at the Liberty Stadium. The 29-year-old spent the first half of the campaign in Wilfried Bony's shadow and appeared to be agitating for a move until the Ivorian was sold to Manchester City in January for an initial £25million fee. But Gomis, who joined from Lyon on a free transfer last summer, has since settled at Swansea and had scored four goals in seven games before being injured against Everton. Loan signing Nelson Oliveira and Marvin Emnes will compete to fill Gomis' spot at Leicester on Saturday.

Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch. Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park. Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager.

"'With two weeks to go until Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao finally get in the ring, it seems no-one is immune to being caught up in the hype.

And even Sky Sports pundits Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry are getting involved as they went face-to-face in the studio. Scroll down for video. Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry face off in anticipation of Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao. Redknapp attempts to goad Henry into a reaction in the early stages as the Arsenal legend stays cool. But both men collapse into giggles as they struggle to maintain the mock tension between them. Redknapp says: 'My friend Thierry Henry thinks he can beat me in a head-to-head. We're going to find out right now; lets have it big man.' The former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder is the more animated of the two as he says, 'you've been giving it all that,' but Henry remains cool. The Arsenal legend pretends to go in with his head and says, 'I know you're scared,' to which Redknapp responds: 'May 2, me and you big man.' The mock tension then disappears, however, as the pair collapse in a fit of giggles. Sky Sports Boxing are asking people to film their own head to heads to celebrate Manny and Money finally fighting.

The Holland national team forward Memphis Depay has reportedly been holding talks with French side Paris Saint-Germain regarding a potential transfer this summer.

According to reports, both Liverpool and Manchester United have expressed their interest in signing the 23-year-old, but it seems like Paris Saint-Germain has the upper hand in this transfer chase.

Depay, who played under Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal when he was still the head coach of the Netherlands national team, could be Van Gaal's first major signing at Old Trafford since he took over the reins at the club last year.

However, it is worth noting that PSG already have some big names in their squad such as Neymar Jr., Kylian Mbappe, and Angel Di Maria, so adding Depay to the mix might be a bit too much for the French side.

Nevertheless, PSG is believed to be very keen on signing Depay this summer and they are willing to offer him a lucrative contract to persuade him to join them.

Smith has lost his last two world title challenges to Arthur Abraham (left) of Germany. Ward defeated Carl Froch in 2011 and could be set for a rematch if he beats Smith. Smith's hope this time round will be that Ward, usually so slick and brilliantly accurate, has diminished through inactivity. The 31-year-old, an Olympic champion and winner of all 27 of his professional fights, has not fought since November 2013. That period of absence will add a fascinating dimension to a fight that will catch the attention of Froch, who would postpone retirement for a home rematch against Ward.' ","#####

"'Young women no longer compare themselves to celebrities in glossy magazines but fret about how they look on Facebook instead, according to a study. They use pictures on the social networking site to gauge their own appearance and see how they measure up against friends. Facebook consumes 40 per cent of the time young women spend online, psychologists at the University of New South Wales in Australia found. Comparison site: A study found women compared themselves to their friends on Facebook rather than celebrities in magazines. The study, of 150 college students and staff aged 17 to 25, found they read magazines ‘infrequently’ but checked Facebook every few hours. The women preferred Facebook as a means of judging themselves because they could compare their looks with peers similar to them and see how they had changed over time. The research comes the same week as an Australian mother received a poison pen letter from a Facebook friend because of her regular updates about her baby daughter. Jade Ruthven, 33, from Perth, was told she was  'p*****g a lot of people off' with her constant statuses about daughter Addison. Measuring up: Women aged 17 to 25 were found to judge themselves alongside pictures of friends rather than celebrities in magazines. She got her own back on the unidentified 'friends' by forwarding it onto comedian Em Rusciano - who shared it with her thousands of followers on social media. Writing in the journal Psychology Of Women Quarterly, researcher Jasmine Fardouly advised women at risk of low self-esteem to post fewer pictures of themselves online and avoid following people who upload them too frequently.'

Peterborough, Cambridgeshire — December 2, 2019, a twelve year old school boy needed to be rescued by firefighters after he fell into an eight foot deep, rubber drain cover that had been kicked out of position.

Firefighters, along with police and an ambulance crew, arrived at the scene and set up a large scuba diving vacuum cleaner in order to retrieve the young boy from the hole. Within hours of the accident occurring, rescue workers successfully brought the child to the surface. Paramedics then stabilized the boy's condition before transporting him to a local hospital. The extent of his injuries will not be known until he has undergone a full medical evaluation.

This recent incident highlights the dangers associated with working near underground utilities such as electricity, gas, water pipes, and sewers. OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) has cited numerous companies in the past for failing to protect their employees from these types of hazards, and has even imposed heavy fines on those found guilty.

Boy racers Lewis and Nicolas Hamilton (right) in the Mercedes garage. Lewis, whose next race is the Spanish Grand Prix on May 10, admits Nicolas shares the family stubborn streak which does not always welcome advice but recently he has been able to adopt a mentor’s role. He said: ‘We Hamiltons are generally very stubborn. We want to do it on our own. We think we can do it without guidance. When my brother was really young, I was always guiding but then he got to an age when he was doing his own thing. But now we’ve got to a stage where my brother is asking me for advice. It’s the greatest feeling to be able to help. ‘I’ve been through the racing world, so hopefully I’ve found a good solution that could help him shape his own solution. I’m really proud of that.’ Asked if his brother was strong, Hamilton said: ‘He’s got very big fists. If he caught you with a punch, you’d know about it. I always make sure that I show him “I’m your older brother”.’ Hamilton crosses the line in Bahrain ahead of Kimi Raikkonen to claim his third win from four races this term. The 30-year-old Briton celebrates his second straight win in Bahrain to extend his lead in the championship.

The caption read: 'My late birthday gift just arrived! But it was worth waiting for! Amazing! Thanks mom & dad!! #inspiration.' Daley Blind showed off the impressive portrait that his parents gave him as a late birthday present. Blind has been a key figure for United this campaign, with his versatility seeing him play in midfield and at left back for Louis van Gaal. With Champions League qualification close to be secured, the Red Devils return to Europe's elite competition is welcoming after their disappointing season last time around. Despite losing to Chelsea at the weekend, United dominated the game and felt they deserved at least a point at the Premier League leaders - which shows the improvements they have made under Van Gaal. Everton head into Sunday's game with their tails up after being unbeaten in their last four and winning three. Wayne Rooney once again returns to his boyhood club, where tensions always run high when the England captain returns to Goodison Park. The versatile Dutch star has become a vital cog in Louis van Gaal's side during the course of the season. Having featured in midfield and left back, Blind has proven his worth since his summer move from Ajax.' ","#####

"'Andrea Pirlo scored a stunning free-kick for Juventus, but couldn't stop his side from sinking to a 2-1 defeat at local rivals Torino. Juve could have wrapped up their fourth consecutive Serie A title with a victory on Sunday and looked on course to after Pirlo's masterful set-piece from 25 yards gave them the lead in the first-half. However, Matteo Darmian equalised for the home side just before the interval and Fabio Quagliarella completed the shock comeback around the hour mark. It was the first time Torino had beaten Juve in the derby for 20 years. Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo puts his side in front against rivals Torino with a stunning free-kick. Despite Pirlo's goal, Juve fell to a 2-1 defeat and missed out on wrapping up their fourth straight Serie A title. Still, Juve remain 14 points clear at the top of the league table and could still win a treble this season. Pirlo is now 35-years-old but is still playing at the top of his game and could earn a contract extension. Still, nothing should be taken away from the veteran Pirlo's unwavering class. At 35-years-old, an age at which many professionals are considering retiring or have already hung up their boots, the Italian playmaker looks as good anyone else in his position. His current contract at Juve expires at the end of next season, but on this evidence it would not be a surprise if the club chose to extend it. Despite defeat on Sunday, Juve are 14 points clear at the top of the league table. Pirlo has been at Juventus since 2011, racking up 156 appearances and scoring 18 goals.

Sky Sports revealed that Jose Mourinho said the Brazilian was taken off due to 'possible concussion' Oscar was knocked back by the goalkeeper but Michael Oliver didn't award Chelsea a penalty. Didier Drogba replaced Oscar at the break, with Sky Sports revealing that Jose Mourinho had told them the decision was taken because of concussion concerns over the latter. It means Oscar played on for half an hour before being properly assessed, potentially bringing the concussion debate into the public domain again. 'He went to the hospital at halftime,' Mourinho said. 'We are waiting. We don't know yet (if it's concussion).' Television pundits Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness and Thierry Henry were all in agreement that it should have been a penalty. Carragher said: 'It was a definitely penalty. It could even be a red card.’ Henry said: 'The adrenalin will sometimes bring you back to the field. Maybe he thought he could not go back on after sitting in the dressing room for 15 minutes.’ Oscar appeared in a bad way immediately after being poleaxed by the Gunners' goalkeeper.

"'Arsenal Fan TV favourite Claude Callegari may well have been speaking for a number of Gunners fans when demanding for the Cesc Fabregas flag to be taken down from the side of the Emirates Stadium.

If Chelsea win at the Emirates, they will need just one more victory to officially claim the 2014-15 Premier League title.

The Uruguayan has struggled in the shadow of Zlatan Ibrahimovic during his time in the French capital, and continued to toil at the Camp Nou, as Laurent Blanc's side went down to a comfortable 2-0 second-leg defeat. But rather than wallow in self-pity, the 28-year-old put on his cardigan and headed for a local zoo.

</human>: What is a stock?
<bot>: In finance, a stock (also capital stock) is all the outstanding shares of a corporation, defined as all stocks (or equity) owned by shareholders, including preferred stock and common stock.[1] A share of corporate stock represents a claim on the company's assets and earnings, similar to a partnership stake or a bond. One investor is known as a holder of stock; one whose holdings are called stock is known as a shareholder.

Each share of a company's stock typically states that the holder is entitled to dividends and owns a proportionate share of the company's assets and earnings. The value of stocks is therefore derived from the earnings of the companies issuing them plus the bonus or dividend paid to shareholders. Thus, price fluctuations in the stock market reflect changes in investors' estimates of the company's value and future earnings. Stock markets allow investors to trade shares of multiple companies at once.

Among them was his father and long-time trainer Roger Mayweather, who guided his son to a successful amateur career and helped him develop his unique defensive style.
Standing alongside Floyd was his uncle and head trainer JR Mayweather, plus his own crew including his cousin Jeff, personal chef Big Boy and security guards.

The Hoops will win the league for the fourth successive season if they beat Dundee at home on Friday night and the Dons fail to win against the Tannadice side on Saturday, which would cap a 'special' campaign for Johansen.

"'Daniel Levy reportedly told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust that after the problems reinvesting the money received for Gareth Bale, future transfer policy would entail the purchase of young players, priced between £10-15million with good potential for resale. This may be financially sensible, but it is hardly reassuring. Elite clubs, those who challenge for the biggest trophies, do not buy with one eye on selling and this strategy would set Tottenham back a decade to a time when they helped solve problems at Manchester United by trading top performers such as Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov. Indeed, the only time Tottenham demonstrated real Champions League potential was when Levy resisted the likes of Chelsea over Luka Modric. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is planning a new transfer policy for the club that centres on resale value. Spurs sold forward Gareth Bale (left) to Real Madrid in 2013 for a world-record £85 million transfer fee. Spurs' best chance of securing regular Champions League football came when Luka Modric played for them. Spurs allowed star performers Dimitar Berbatov (left) and Michael Carrick (right) to join Manchester United. The moment they started to sell again, Tottenham fell away. Not even having the Premier League's top goalscorer in Harry Kane has placed them among the elite again — and it is hard to see how that will change if this is the plan.

","#####What does it mean to be human?######
This question has been asked throughout history and forms the basis of many philosophical discussions and research. At its core, being human is a complex and multifaceted experience that involves emotions, cognitive abilities, and the capacity for self-reflection. However, there are also fundamental aspects of our humanity that are shared with other living beings, such as the ability to feel pleasure and pain, the need for companionship, and the desire for survival.

One of the most significant features of being human is our ability to use language to communicate ideas and experiences to others. Language allows us to express thoughts and feelings, describe events, and share beliefs and values. It is through language that we form relationships, create communities, and transmit knowledge from one generation to another.

Another aspect of our humanity is our capacity for creativity. Humans are natural-born artists, writers, musicians, and inventors, who possess the unique ability to imagine new possibilities and to innovate. We are all born with certain innate creative abilities, such as the ability to imagine new concepts, to problem solve, and to make logical deductions. However, these abilities can be developed and enhanced through practice, education, and exposure to different cultural expressions.

Captured in a 15-second clip, the youngster emulates the way her pregnant mother walks - and the result is hilarious. The 15-month-old girl arches her back and pushes out her belly while strutting around the room. The youngster pulls a cheeky face while her father also mimics the mum's pregnant walk in the background. The clip begins with mum, American Teri O'Neil, 30, asking 15-month-old Olivia: ‘How does mama walk?’ while filming at her home. Suddenly the youngster appears from the side of the shot and with her back bent and tummy pushed forward she struts past. She pulls a cheeky face as she continues around the room – in the background her father can be seen emulating the walk with her. The video concludes with Olivia briefly interacting with the dog, who jumps out of the way, and walking towards the camera with a beaming smile. According to Teri, she recorded the video when she was six months pregnant with her son Liam. The mother of two writes about her children on her blog and has documented everything from their birth stories to the everyday things they get up to.

"'A taxi driver channelled his inner Pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers. The Uber driver was filmed by passengers as he sang along to a radio broadcast while driving in Boston, America. At first the driver lets the radio take command and Pavarotti’s distinctive voice can be heard from within side the cab. At first the driver lets the radio play before he begins singing along to the Pavarotti song in perfect tune. He then begins singing along himself – loudly so that he is audible above the radio and the sounds of the road. While looking around as he drives, the Uber worker continues to sing along to the song both in tune and word perfectly. The song then concludes with the video maker saying: ‘Wow’ and the taxi driver falling silent as the outro music plays. The passenger filming then says: ‘Wow, that was brilliant. Thank you very much.’ He then asks whether the man was singing along to Pavarotti, to which the driver says yes. Reality is then restored as the passenger finishes praising the driver and instructs him to keep going straight. The passengers are amazed as they film the driver who sings along   to the opera song word perfectly. Later, the film maker wrote: ‘We were heading out to meet some friends at a party in South Boston and had a wonderful journey with the Uber Opera Man.’ Luciano Pavarotti was one of the most commercially successful tenors of all time and one of the Three Tenors.

To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him. Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws. Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick. After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off. He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter.

Footage shows his head slowly dipping down before he suddenly wakes up and refocuses his energy on the screen. Ready to nap: He keeps repeating the same action before finally giving a defeated stretch and big yawn. Other videos show five-year-old Sam looking slightly more energetic. In one clip the pooch is seen playing at a local dog park and in another he enthusiastically licks a jar of peanut butter. To date the video of Sam in sleeping mode has been watched more than 100,000 times with many deeming the scene 'cute' and 'adorable'. One commenter added: 'What a sweet baby. I think the best part is that he has his arm draped over the guy. So adorable!''

Mr. Abbott, the Australian Prime Minister, surprised many attendees at a Sydney Australian Rules Football Club (AUFC) event when he downed a beer in one go. Many people were present during the incident, including the team's coach, Simon Carroudes. Mr. Abbott initially refused the request from Coach Carroudes to drink beer, but after some coaxing, he accepted the offer and had a drink. 

It is worth noting that Mr. Abbott is a recovering alcoholic, and it is unclear whether or not this episode constitutes a violation of his sobriety. However, according to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Abbott appeared to enjoy himself thoroughly, drinking the whole bottle in less than a minute. Additionally, he made a short speech to the players, praising their skill and dedication. Overall, the event was considered a success, with plenty of spirited cheering and skolking (drinking from the bottom of the bottle to the top).

"'An American woman proved that she is no arachnophobe when she posed with her rather snappy pet tarantula and allowed it to bite her hand. Footage shows exotic pet owner Kayonna Cole holding her female rose hair spider up to the camera as it digs its fangs into her skin. Kayonna, who filmed the moment at her home in Los Angeles, remains calm throughout the video, but later suffered a reaction to the spider's venom. Kayonna holds her hand steady and remains calm as the tarantula removes its fangs from her skin. Clearly visible are the tarantula’s fangs, which it immediately begins to use to pinch away at Kayonna’s hand. Unflinching, Kayonna holds her hand steady as the tarantula removes its fangs from her skin and tucks them in slightly. Later in the video the spider begins pinching her once more and even appears to puncture the surface of her skin. Kayonna bravely holds her female rose hair spider up to the camera while it demonstrates its biting action. But once again the spider's owner remains remarkably calm and holds her hand still for the spider. Kayonna wrote online that the tarantula was showing aggression or possibly testing her fangs. She wrote: ‘Her bites were not painful, the after effects from the venom were more painful with the symptoms being slight redness of the skin surrounding the bites, soreness and itching. ‘This species of tarantula has low toxicity venom similar to that of a bee sting.'

"'Lada Niva 4x4 £13,395 on the road. As a result of the Land Rover Defender's demise, there could be a boom in sales of a Russian badge which was a butt of many jokes in the Soviet era – the Lada. Lada's 4x4 Niva has long been the car that bucked the trend of laughing at the Russian carmaker and has won fans around the world thanks to its robust nature and chunky looks. We take a look. The Niva (pictured) is a highly capable, ruftytufty 4x4 from Russia — for a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover and it is also available in a compact van format (£10,590, excluding VAT and road tax) GOOD. Forget luxuries because the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone, the upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior (pictured) is easy to mop down after a day in the mud. BAD. Patriotic Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured) drove a Lada Niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a German engine.' ","##### PATRIOTISM #####

The Niva is available with a range of engines, including gasoline, diesel, and liquified petroleum gas (LPG). However, the most popular engine is the 1.5-liter four-cylinder turbocharged diesel unit produced by German automotive giant Volkswagen Group. This engine delivers up to 85 horsepower and 195 Nm of torque, enabling the Niva to accelerate from zero to sixty miles per hour in 14 seconds and reach a top speed of 103 miles per hour.

##### RESILIENCE #####

One of the key features of the Niva is its ability to handle a variety of terrain, including snow, sand, gravel, and mud. It comes standard with a mechanical locking rear differential, Hill Descent Control, and a reinforced suspension system that can withstand heavy loads and off-road abuse. Additionally, the Niva has a ground clearance of 230mm and a wading depth of 600mm, making it suitable for driving through shallow water.

"'Former Arsenal flop Nicklas Bendtner was not included in the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday's draw against Schalke as punishment for turning up late for training on Friday. The Denmark international was due to start the match but ended up being dropped from the entire squad after his poor timekeeping landed him in hot water with manager Dieter Hecking. The Wolfsburg boss probably didn't need an invitation to lose his temper after watching his side crumble to a 4-1 home defeat by Napoli in the Europa League on Thursday and was obviously angered when Bendtner rolled up late the next day. Nicklas Bendtner was dropped from the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday's game after arriving late for training. Manager Dieter Hecking said that Bendtner would have started the match if he hadn't turned up late. 'Nicklas was going to play from the beginning but our training session was clearly earlier than he thought,' said boss Hecking. Sporting director Klaus Allofs added: 'There are a lot of ways of finding out when training is. And it is not as if there is that much traffic in Wolfsburg.' Hecking, speaking to Danish newspaper BT, said: 'As a team we have some rules that everyone should keep. When you break those rules you have to take the consequences. But we have spoken to Nicklas and everything is OK again.' Bendtner responded to the decision to drop him on Instagram on Sunday. He wrote: 'Stay strong and look forward. Mistakes can be made, but you got to deal with it and keep progressing.' The 27-year-old has only scored once in 16 league appearances this season since his arrival in Germany last summer. Bendtner has only netted once in the Bundesliga since joining Wolfsburg last summer.' ","#####

The 19-time champion jockey could have ridden Cause of Causes who, like his mount Shutthefrontdoor, is owned by his boss JP McManus. He has ridden him three times before. While it was ultimately no surprise he chose Shutthefrontdoor, a runner with strong credentials, Cause of Causes also has very good reasons why he should be backed. Cause of Causes at Cheltenham last month. He was second at the 2014 Cheltenham Festival and then landed the four-mile National Hunt Chase at last month’s meeting. That marks him down as a quality performer, and he is ridden by a Grand National winning jockey in Paul Carberry (Bobbyjo, 1999) and trained by a race-winning trainer in Gordon Elliott (Silver Birch, 2007). His four mile Cheltenham win indicates reserves of stamina for the four-and-a-half-mile, 30-fence test which I like to see in my Grand National hopes. Shutthefrontdoor, the 2014 Irish National winner, is also strong on that score. I like last year’s runner-up Balthazar King and 2014 Scottish National winner Al Co, as well as Godsmejudge, second in that race having won it in 2013. For those looking for an each-way punt at more speculative odds, Royale Knight is a horse which has caught my eye. I will be cheering on my two sons.

"'Francis Coquelin has jumped to the defence of team-mate Olivier Giroud following Thierry Henry's claim that Arsenal need a 'top quality striker' to win the Premier League next season. Despite Giroud scoring 14 Premier League goals for Arsene Wenger's side this campaign, Henry believes he must sign a new striker as well as three more players if they are to compete for the title. Speaking after the 0-0 draw with Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday, Henry told Sky Sports: 'They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again.'

The French midfielder told RMC: 'Thierry Henry is wrong. Giroud shows his potential every week. 'He showed that he has the level to be the Arsenal striker and we can win titles with him. 'We are disappointed with the result against Chelsea because we were on a good run.

"'This is the amazing scene as a freelance photographer risks his life to capture an image of a hungry lion from just a few feet away. Fearless Atif Saeed, 38, from Lahore, Pakistan was in the city's safari park when he spotted the male lion in the distance. Mr Saeed got out of his car and crept up towards the hunter armed only with a camera and fired off a few frames. Atif Saeed crept to within 10 feet of the hungry lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground. Armed only with a camera, Mr Saeed, managed to capture a couple of frames before retreating to safety. Unfortunately, the clicking sound of the camera's shutter alerted the lion to Mr Saeed's presence, who was forced to retreat quite rapidly from just 10 feet away from the lion. He said: 'I was sitting in front of him just near my car and the door of my car was open. I was sat on ground few feet away, so he was treating me like his prey. 'I was thinking - I must show the character and status of lion and this was the only way I could think of to achieve this.

"'A hardware store worker has been found guilty of ejaculating in his female colleague's coffee in a bid to get noticed. John R.

Ramsey County District Court heard that he masturbated over her desk multiple times while she was away. John R. Lind, 34, (left) admitted tainting Pat Maahs' (right) drink with his semen while they worked together at Beisswenger’s hardware store in New Brighton, Minnesota. Initially, Maahs thought the coffee smelled bad because the milk in the office was spoiled. She told the Minneapolis Star Tribune: 'I’m glad he’s getting something, because I believe he deserves some punishment. So far, my sentence is greater than his. Lind pleaded guilty to indecent exposure, defined as engaging in lewd or indecent behavior. He will be sentenced for the misdemeanor on May 22. The case led to Maahs proposing legislation that would make such an act a felony.

"'A college sophomore who died of excessive alcohol consumption drank a 60-ounce bottle of vodka during what college officials said was the hazing of pledges at an unsanctioned fraternity, according to court papers filed in connection to the case.

Officers in Paramus, Bergen County, responded to an animal that was headbutting a door in the wealthy community, according to their Facebook page. The goat was then captured in the middle of a roadway by three policemen around 5pm on Saturday. A plastic bag was used to avoid contact with the livestock, and it was handed over to animal control, a Paramus Police Department spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. A goat in Paramus, New Jersey, was apprehended by police after it was found headbutting a door in the wealthy community. The animal was not injured in the incident. Police are still working to find the owner of the goat and are asking the public for help. Several goats live at a home nearby where Saturday's was found, police told NorthJersey.com. Comments on social media suggested that the animal could have been fleeing the prospect of being someone's Easter dinner. A woman from Oregon offered a $250 reward for the return of her pet goat Pete this week after it was stolen. She worried about someone eating him, but said that he'd be chewy, according to the Oregonian.

Officers in Paramus, New Jersey, responded to an animal causing a ruckus. This is a story about disorderly animals and how they were brought to order, or at least brought to people's attention. It seems like some animals just don't know their place—in this case, confined to herds or pens, or kept as pets. But when they escape their pens or flocks, anything can happen.

A ""goat was shepherded away"" after causing trouble in a neighborhood. In other words, the police had to intervene to keep the peace between two warring factions: humans and goats. It's unclear what sparked the conflict, but tensions often run high during the holiday season, especially around Easter time. Goats may be cunning and elusive, but they're not very bright; evidently, this particular herd lacks a wise elder who can counsel them on the dangers of venturing into neighborhoods uninvited.

The police were forced to step in and quell the disturbance. They did so professionally, of course, using plastic bags and safe distance as recommended by experts.

David Hyche, now a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), developed the technology nine years ago when his four-month-old daughter turned blind. A transmitter is placed inside plastic eggs that let off a high-pitched beeping sound. Now Hyche has passed on the idea to the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Birmingham. Festive invention: Blind children in Birmingham, Alabama, have celebrated Easter early by hunting for plastic eggs that let of a beeping sound. They trade the eggs in for candy. The device: Bomb expert David Hyche put a transmitter in a plastic egg so his daughter could join the fun. 'With my daughter, one of her first phrases was, 'I do it myself.' She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too,' he told WBRC. 'It's logical for people who are explosives investigators. It's just a battery, beeper and a switch... pretty simple.' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy. 'We love to give the opportunity for our children with disabilities and their families to come out and have the same opportunity as everybody else does,' said Tamara Harrison with the Alabama Institute.

"'Beach-goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at Victoria's picturesque Rye Beach last week - a swimming echidna! The prickly Australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the Mornington Peninsula, 83 km south of Melbourne. Where it was heading, is anyone's guess. Scroll down for video. This echidna was spotted paddling out to sea off Rye Beach, a popular surfing and fishing spot on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. The video of the swimming echidna, which looks to be happily using its ant-eating snout as a snorkel, was posted online by YouTube user Emma B. According to Australia Zoo, echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers. They like the water so much, that the Zoo built a special  swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days. Echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean. The echidna - or spiny ant-eater - is  found all over Australia, in coastal forests, alpine meadows and desert habitats. They live on a diet of ants, termites, grubs and worms but biologists think the mammals evolved from aquatic ancestors like the platypus. Gary Sutton, a park ranger from Narawntapu National Park in Tasmania, said he has also seen  wallabies and wombats surfing. He previously told the ABC he thought the animals went in the water to get rid of parasites, like lice and ticks. With its webbed-feet and snout in the air as a snorkle, the little echidna paddled out to sea.' ","#####echidna

The arrested officer has been placed on administrative leave while the investigation is underway. #####
Police departments across the country are taking measures to address concerns about officer misconduct. In March 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a police union in a case involving disciplinary records and implied that access to such records should be considered a ""significant interest.""

It's important for citizens to hold officers accountable for their actions and ensure that those who violate the public trust are held responsible. But it's equally important to respect the rights of all individuals, including police officers, to due process and a fair trial.

"'A Louisiana volunteer police officer was arrested Saturday night after allegedly drunkenly stealing a patrol boat and taking it for a joy ride that ended when he crashed into a riverside bar and grill. Danny Eckhart was intoxicated, his former co-workers in St. Tammany Parish say, when he took the vessel out on the Tchefuncte River and smashed it into pilings outside the T-Rivers Bar in Madisonville. No one was injured in the crash. However, Eckhart faces charges of unauthorized use of a vehicle and operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Accused: Volunteer St. Tammany Parish cop Danny Eckhart is accused of drunkenly taking a police patrol boat for a joy ride and then crashing it into a riverside bar. He also did an unknown amount of damage to the patrol boat when authorities say he took it out 'while not acting in any official capacity,' said spokesman Capt. George Bonnett on Sunday. Police did not release his age, work history or blood alcohol level at the time of his arrest to the The Times-Picayune. Eckhart was booked into the St. Tammany Parish Jail and later released on $7,500 bond. Bonnett told the Times-Picayune that restitution for damages to the boat will be pursued in court. Decommissioned: Police say Eckhart damaged the water craft when he crashed it into T-Rivers bar and Grill in Madisonville. He was arrested and stripped of his commission.' ","##### Arrest

"'A wallaby has been caught on camera delivering a swift jab to an unsuspecting wombat who invaded his personal space while he was grazing in a Victorian National Park. Shocked onlookers started filming the native pair at the Wilsons Promontory National Park, in the Gippsland region in southeast Victoria, as the wombat waddled over to the unsuspecting wallaby. Scroll down for video. Sucker punch: A wallaby shocked on lookers as he 'punched' a wombat who approached him while he was grazing. In a performance you would expect from a boxing kangaroo, the wallaby turned around and gave the wombat a little crack on the nose after it seemingly got a little too close for comfort. Onlookers were shocked by the actions of the wallaby but it looks like there's no bad blood between the two native Australian's as they both continued happily grazing in the area straight after the encounter. The wombat had no idea what he was in for as he approached the unsuspecting wallaby. Unlike this encounter, wallabies typically use their strong hind legs to deliver a powerful kick when they are feeling threatened. Wilsons Promontory National Park is home to a range of wildlife including kangaroos, emus, echidnas and numerous other smaller marsupials. The wildlife there has become quite accustomed to human presence and animals will often approach people or enter tents looking for food. Make sure you remember that it's illegal to feed wildlife in the national park and if you're caught could be slapped with a fine by park rangers.' ","#####

"'Sometimes a shrill alarm tone isn't enough to get you out of bed. And for one lazy dog, even a constant head-pounding couldn't rouse her from sleep. Lori Smith filmed her pooch Boomer being repeatedly hit as she lay with her head resting on the ledge of her electronic dog door. With the door jammed, it is seen constantly moving up and down hitting her skull each time. 'She just sits here all day and doesn't even care,' Smith is heard saying as she watches the scene play out. 'That's awful!' a man  in the background adds. However, he can't help but giggle as he observes Boomer refusing to budge. After more than 20 seconds and numerous head taps, Boomer appears resting in the same position.

"'J.B. Silverthorn got charged with a DUI moments after being convicted for his first on Monday. A 44-year-old man got charged with a DUI moments after being convicted for his first, after allegedly turning up to court drunk and driving away. Police say they repeatedly told J.B. Silverthorn of Orchard Park, New York, to not drive home from Grand Island Town Court on Monday night after they noticed he 'smelled of alcohol' and was 'intoxicated'. But the suspect reportedly proceeded to get in his car and pull out of the parking lot before being stopped by deputies. Silverthorn was charged with felony DUI, meaning he could serve a minimum of one year in jail. He was also booked for driving without headlights. He's currently being held in the Erie County jail with his bail set at $1,000. It couldn't be determined if he has a lawyer. Silverthorn was deemed guilty this week for driving over the limit and crashing his car into the Niagara River on December 29. He was stranded three-feet deep in moving water and rescued by firefighters. He's due back in court Monday for a felony hearing. However, if he posts bail, the date could be pushed back to April 22.

"'Carefree: Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol Monday night in Dummerston, Vermont. This mugshot certainly won't be winning any points with the judge. Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested on Monday for drunk driving and decided to stick out her tongue when she was brought to Vermont State Police barracks for booking. Police say the woman from Shelburne, Massachusetts was driving drunk around 10:30pm when she ran off Route 5 in Dummerston, Vermont and crashed her 2011 Toyota Camry into a wooden fence. At the scene, MacDonald told responding officers that she crashed while talking on the phone and trying to take directions down on a legal note pad in her car. But when officers smelled alcohol on MacDonald, they administered a breathalyzer test and she posted a .10 blood-alcohol content - above the state's legal threshold of .08. MacDonald stuck out her tongue for the cheeky picture after she was arrested and brought back to police headquarters on charges of driving while intoxicated. Police say that though MacDonald's car was heavily damaged, neither she or anyone else was injured in the one-vehicle crash. MacDonald was released on a citation and is scheduled back in court on April 28 for an arraignment. Public records do not indicate MacDonald has been arrested for DWI in the past. Sentencing for a first offense in Vermont range from a license suspension of 90 days to up to two years in prison and a maximum fine of $750.' ","##### Arrested for drunk driving #####

'We are expecting a lot of visitors over the next few days.' A black flamingo was reportedly last spotted in Israel in 2014 and aside from its colour, it is no different to the hundreds of pink flamingos which flock to the salt lakes of Cyprus every spring. Experts believe a rare genetic irregularity known as ""melanism"" can generate more melanin than usual, turning a flamingo's feathers a dark colour. Migrating: The bird looked very healthy despite its unusual hue and is believed to be heading to Turkey to breed. Martin Hellicar of the conservation group BirdLife Cyprus said the black-coloured flamingo was not unique, though acknowledged they were uncommon in the Mediterranean. He said it was probably migrating to its breeding area in Turkey after spending the winter elsewhere. He added that the flamingo stopped on its journey in the salt lake to feed on brine shrimp.'

#####Respondent:######
Readers must look carefully if they want to see the female model, who is crouched on a rock covered in green, grey and black paint.
#####Explanation:######
In this prompt, I have selected a passage from a news article about a painter who created an optical illusion. The article describes how the painter spent hours painting a female model so that she would disappear into her surroundings. The goal of the painter was to create a sense of depth and perspective in the painting, using various paints and techniques.

When viewed from a particular angle, the painting appears to show a realistic depiction of a forest scene, with trees, plants, and rocks appearing naturally in the background. However, when viewed from a different angle, it becomes clear that the ""forest"" is actually just a canvas painted in the most masterful way.

The use of color, texture, and brushstrokes creates a sense of realism that fools the eye, making the painted figure seem to fade into the background. This type of art is known"," The stunning illusion was created by German body-painting artist Joerg Duesterwald. | True |

"'A species of whale that was feared to be extinct has been found washed up on a West Australian beach, giving scientists an opportunity to learn more about the mammal. The Omura's whale was discovered on a remote Exmouth beach, at the tip of the state's North West Cape, after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn tore through the area last month. It is the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Identifying the 5.68m juvenile female was at first difficult for Department of Parks and Wildlife staff, who eventually confirmed it was an Omura's whale with DNA profiling. Scroll down for video. An Omura's whale was discovered on a remote Exmouth beach in WA (pictured). It left authorities confused as they struggled to identify the rare species. Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the find was 'highly significant' for whale scientists because very little was known about the species. 'Omura's whale was only described in scientific journals for the first time in 2003 and is apparently restricted to tropical and subtropical waters,' he said. 'The knowledge we gain from this whale will help to improve field identification guides to better understand the whale's regional distribution.' The species is usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. Omura's whales have a sleek body shape and several unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried and the skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific investigation and possibly for public display in museums.

The body of a missing hiker has been found three weeks after he vanished trying to climb Britain's highest mountain. Kyle Knox, from London, was last seen alive at the foot of Ben Nevis on March 31. The 23-year-old was reported missing the following day when he failed to return to his hotel in Fort William. When he vanished people were being urged not to go to Scotland's mountains unless they had the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions. The mercury had plunged to minus seven and winds of up to 70mph were recorded in the region. There was also snow on the mountain's peak. It was believed Kyle, who was not an experienced walker, had attempted to climb the Ben Nevis alone. When he set off on the climb Kyle was wearing dark waterproof trousers, walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it. Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were launched after the alarm was raised, with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene. Search and rescue dogs also joined in the hunt for missing Kyle. Rescuers were forced to call off the hunt due to band weather in the Scottish Highlands.

"'The British Army fired 46 million bullets at the Taliban during the eight-year Afghanistan conflict at a cost of £200 million in ammunition alone. The large amount of ammunition expended during the conflict shows the intense nature of the fighting between British troops and their Taliban opponents. According to data released by the Ministry of Defence, some 27 million 5.56 rounds were fired from either the standard SA-80 assault rifle or minimi machine gun. The British Army fired approximately 10,000 rounds from their SA-80 assault rifles during Afghan conflict. Each of the 5.56mm rounds, pictured, used in the SA-80 assault rifle costs approximately 50p. Each round cost approximately 50p. A further two million 9mm rounds were fired from handguns. According to a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mirror, at least 80,000, 105mm artillery shells - at a cost of £1,250 each - were fired at Taliban positions. Soldiers went through an estimated £5,000 worth of ammunition for the their assault rifles every day during the eight-year conflict. A further 55,000, 30mm rounds were fired from Apache gunships. Each of these rounds costs about £65, but are able to go through solid concrete and can destroy a Taliban vehicle in seconds. The helicopters are able to provide vital close air support for ground troops pinned down by the opposition. SAS veteran Robert Henry Craft told the Mirror: 'The amount of ammo expended shows how British troops in Afghanistan were fighting for their lives every day. 'That so many 9mm rounds were used shows how close the fighting was at times'. The conflict claimed 453 UK lives. One former SAS solider, not pictured, said British troops were fighting for their lives on a daily basis.' ","##### Sure

"'Two children have been killed in what police are calling an accidental vehicle fire at a Las Vegas apartment complex. Investigators say four children were playing in and around a parked minivan Saturday evening at the Arcadia Palms on East Sahara Avenue  when one of them unintentionally set a fire inside. Two of the children managed to escape unharmed and quickly requested help. The other two children became trapped and were found dead inside after the fire was put out. Two young children have died after a minivan they were playing in on the parking lot of the Arcadia Palms apartment complex in Las Vegas caught fire and exploded (police scene pictured) Police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental, and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child who started the fire. The names and ages of the children as well as the cause of the fire were not immediately released. Kelvin Young, 29, a resident of the complex, told the Las Vegas Review Journal he went toward the burning vehicle after he saw a plume of smoke. Shortly after, he described hearing a woman shout 'My baby!' and 'My nephew!' Another resident told KLAS-TV that a woman, believed to be one of the boy's mother, was taken to hospital shortly after the incident and described hearing a huge explosion.

Students at Wellington College, in Berkshire, spent the last year studying a different classic book for their imminent AS-level exam. The mistake only came to light when mock papers arrived and no exam questions related to the taught text. Prestigious: A spokeswoman for the school, which charges £33,000-a-year, said parents had been satisfied by the prompt actions of the school after staff discovered they had been teaching the wrong English text. Now pupils will have to cram their studying into just a few weeks with extra lessons put in place by the school. Sources close to the school, which proudly boasts to be the Best Public School in the Tatler Schools Guide 2014 on its website, said students were left devastated by the blunder. The mistake is believed to have occurred when a teacher changed a text on a spreadsheet without notifying other staff. According to The Sun, the college, whose alumni includes Will Young, Rory Bremner and Made in Chelsea's Caggie Dunlop, apologised for the error but would not name the works of literature involved. Stumped: Students at the posh school are said to be upset by the blunder which has seen nearly a year of hard work go to waste (file photo) A spokeswoman said: 'Only one AS-level English text was wrong out of several.

Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. The 57-year-old has criticised the 'absolutely ridiculous'  investigation after he was told he will face no further action. Mr Rose said: 'The officers told me today that I have now entered the political world and I must no longer hand out sausage rolls. 'They told me I have got to watch anything I do.

"'Nigel Farage, pictured after Reckless's defection to Ukip, is likely to look a little less smug after it was revealed the Rochester and Strood MP is facing an uphill struggle to keep his seat. The Tory MP who defected to Ukip to trigger the Rochester and Strood by-election is on course to lose the seat at the General Election. According to the latest secret polling bombshell to hit Nigel Farage’s party, Mark Reckless, who became Ukip’s second MP last November, faces an uphill battle to hold on to his 2,920 majority on May 7. The disclosure comes after Ukip was thrown into turmoil by last week’s leak to The Mail on Sunday of a survey showing Mr Farage trailing the Tories in his target seat of Thanet South. The private Rochester data is understood to put Mr Reckless narrowly behind the Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst, who he defeated in November’s by-election. When Mr Reckless stood for the Tories at the 2010 Election he had a majority of just under 10,000 votes. As with the Thanet South poll, the party has decided against publicising the figures in case supporters are demoralised. A senior Ukip source said: ‘It is not looking easy for Mark, but we are hopeful the figures are misleading.’ However, another source added: ‘We aren’t that bothered because Reckless isn’t particularly popular.’ Some analysts think Ukip could be left with just one MP – Douglas Carswell, who won Clacton in a byelection with a 12,000 majority. Last night Ukip denied the party had itself commissioned polling in Rochester but said: ‘We always knew it would be a tough fight.’ Ukip convert Mark Reckless faces an uphill battle to hold on to his 2,920 majority in Rochester and Strood.' ","#####HEADING1###

So, according to the passage, we can conclude that the Tory MP, Mark Reckless, is facing an uphill battle to retain his seat in the upcoming election this may due to his previous major vote margin of almost 10,000 people. Furthermore, the article mentions that the party officials are concerned about the recent internal surveys which predict a potential defeat for Reckless.

However, the author doesn't provide any sources or citations regarding the information disclosed in the passage. Therefore, it's difficult to verify the authenticity or accuracy of these claims. It's worth noting that while the tone of the article seems neutral, it could be bias towards the political parties involved in the by-elections. Additionally, it's important to consider the potential motivations or agendas of the individuals or organizations responsible for producing the polls or surveys cited in the article.

In conclusion, while the text provides some insights into the potential electoral challenges facing Reckless, further research and investigation are needed to fully understand the situation and to ensure the reliability of any related statistics or data.

Scene: Scott Kemery gave himself first and second degree burns after he set fire to himself by mistake in the parking lot of the King Kullen supermarket in Eastport on Tuesday. Kemery, told police that he rented the car in Florida and drove north to the Hamptons and discovered the car had bedbugs. He said that a friend had explained to him the best way to kill bedbugs was to douse them in alcohol. Inspired, Kemery did just that. However, he then made the near fatal mistake of getting into the car and lighting his cigarette, thereby igniting the alchol and setting himself on fire. Bedbugs: Mr. Kemery had been reliably informed by a friend that the best way to kill bedbugs was to douse them in alcohol. He did not think not to light a cigarette in his car afterwards was a bad idea. Authorities said that they did not believe the fire was criminal in nature and that they were not going to pursue an investigation.

"'At Tokyo's Narita Airport, the newly-opened Terminal 3 sure has some quirky features. Among them, strips of brightly-coloured running track, which have been installed in the airport's hallways. While of course passengers are entertained by the latest buzzworthy stunt, we have to wonder: were they really intended to encourage travellers to dash to their boarding gate? Tokyo's Narita Airport has installed running tracks in its new Terminal 3 in honour of the 2020 Olympics. Turns out that the cushioned tracks were actually designed to celebrate the 2020 Olympics, which will be held in Tokyo. But there's no denying that the footpaths are extremely useful regardless. The blue path leads passengers toward departures, while arrivals can be reached by following the red pathway. Further, in each lane there are a series of icons, which include information such as the distance to other terminals, directions to nearby restaurants and shops and where to find outside transport options. The recently-opened terminal will be primarily used for departures and arrivals of low-cost carriers. To save money, the airport installed these cushioned running tracks, which also include directional information. All of the blue lanes lead towards the departure area, while the red track leads travellers to arrivals. The new terminal, which will be used for many of the city's low-cost carrier departures, first opened on April 8 and according to the website, the aim of the innovative tracks was, in part, to save money. 'To cut costs, we opted not to install the typical moving walkways or illuminated signs,' the terminal's website reads. 'Instead, to offer an exciting walking experience that is easy on the feet, we implemented running tracks used for track and field, and added signage for user-friendly guidance.''

The Airbus A319 flew two circuits around Malta, with final section skirting the Italian coast. The Air Malta passenger jet took the unusual flight path, pictured, to celebrate the wedding of two of its crew. The special flight was to celebrate the marriage one of the airline's pilot to a member of cabin crew. The jet took the happy couple's family and friends on a short sight-seeing tour over the Mediterranean. The arrivals' board at Malta International Airport provided some clues as to the reason behind the unusual flight path with the status 'Just Married' placed beside flight KM 14JC. A spokeswoman for Air Malta told Sky News that the couple were married at the airport earlier that day. She revealed: 'They are both members of staff at Air Malta. 'He is a pilot and she is a member of cabin crew. They were joined on the flight by family, friends and colleagues who had been at the wedding. 'I think it was a very romantic flight.

"'Puren - who has died aged 96 - was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi (above), who ruled for four years until 1912. The brother of China's last emperor who was pushed off the throne more than 100 years ago has died. Puren was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi, who ruled for four years until 1912. The 96-year-old died on Friday after being taken to hospital with pneumonia in February, his family said. He had been suffering from poor health and memory loss in recent years. One of his sons told The Legal Evening News that Puren - who took the Chinese name Jin Youzhi - was 'almost deaf'. 'He even couldn't hold a pen... he couldn't recognise people,' the son added. Puyi became emperor in 1908 when he was two years and ten months old. His abdication ended the rule of the Qing dynasty, which began in 1644. After the government took power in 1912 Puyi and his close family were forced to live within the walls of the Forbidden City, where they retained imperial traditions and were tended to by eunuchs. They were expelled from the palace complex in 1917. Puren established a primary school with the help of his father in the 1940s and continued to teach until he retired in the late 1960s. He reportedly had three sons and two daughters. The Communist party which took power in 1949 also reportedly gave him a place on the local Beijing branch of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a mostly symbolic body. A memorial for Puren will be held at the Babaoshan Cemetery in Beijing. The former emperor is pictured (right) with their father and younger brother in front of a beautiful picture.' ","#####

The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were met with this 'announcement' on a big TV screen. The message was displayed for five hours before one of the centre's supervisors told workers that it was an April Fools' Day prank. The workers had good cause to fear for their jobs: DFAT is planning to cut 500 jobs by June. The main role of the employees involved in the parnk is to ensure passport applicants meet the requirements in a process known as 'ELLO'.

Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges. Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around.

They said in 1950 that a Labour government wouldn’t introduce charging and it did.’ The introduction of prescription charges prompted NHS founder Nye Bevan to resign from Clement Attlee’s government in April 1951. Dr Porter said it was ‘inescapable’ that the next government would consider introducing fees as a way of tackling the £30billion budget gap that NHS England has forecast will open by 2020 unless it achieves its target of £22billion in efficiency savings and receives £8billion of extra annual funding.

The NHS is facing a financial crisis. Years of underfunding, an aging population, and increased demand for healthcare have put immense strain on the system. As a result, hospitals are struggling to provide timely care, and essential resources are being rationed. This can lead to longer wait times, missed diagnoses, and even death in some cases. 
In order to address this crisis, we need a long-term plan for funding the NHS. This plan should include increasing taxes for high-income earners, closing tax loopholes used by large corporations, and investing in preventative care programs. We also need to address the root causes of poverty and inequality, which are factors that contribute to poor health outcomes.

The Truckee River runs through Nevada and California, starting in the Sierra Nevada mountains and flowing into the Pacific Ocean just north of Reno. Native Americans lived along the banks of the Truckee River for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers. In the mid-1800s, the river was used as a route for freight wagons moving between Carson City, Nevada, and Sacramento, California.

In the late 1800s, the first railroad line connecting Virginia City, Montana, to Salt Lake City, Utah, was built alongside the Truckee River. This made it easier for miners to get their gold and silver out of the region, leading to a boomtown culture developing in the area around the river.

During the 1960s and 1970s, as Tahoe became a popular tourist destination, many local residents advocated for improvements to the downtown area. One of the most significant changes was the renovation of the area along the Truckee River, which had been neglected for decades. The city completed the Riverwalk project in 1987, transforming a former stretch of railway track into a paved path stretching for nearly two miles along the riverbank.

"'A French bus driver has proposed putting on a separate service for Roma passengers - because the 'unbearable' smell is a health risk to everyone on board. Dominique Granier sparked outrage after he suggested putting on a service specifically for people travelling from a Roma encampment next to a cemetery into the centre of Montpellier, in the south of France. But while his comments were immediately met with horror by some, the bus company TAM has taken his comments seriously and is said to have 'outsourced' part of the route. Odour: The smell on route 9 in Montpellier is said to be 'unbearable' and caused by Roma using the service. Bus driver Mr Granier said the smell which accompanied the Roma was a 'sanitation risk' in an interview last week. Speaking to the Gazette de Montpelier Mr Granier said: 'It is a true infection.' His claims were backed up by other drivers, one of whom claimed the buses were now specially cleaned because of the odour. Bernard Gotis, a local union representative, was disgusted by the comments. 'We should not tackle the poor, but poverty... We do not want to recreate apartheid in Montpellier,' he said. Apartheid: Some have said the problem is poverty of those living in the camp. Pictured: Roma in Montpellier. However, Mr Gotis revealed the bus company had taken on the suggestion, and apparently outsourced part of the route so drivers no longer had to contend with the smell. He told French newspaper Libération: 'Our management decided to follow the union by removing a piece of this bus line which is very popular with Roma and to outsource this portion of line.' The MailOnline has contacted Montpellier's bus service for a comment.' ","##### Human: ##### What are the most important aspects of having a pet?
<bot>: ##### Response: ##### Here are six important reasons why you should own a pet:
1. Companionship: Pets can provide us companionship, love, and emotional support similar to what human relationships offer. They can also help to fill the void left by lost loved ones or friends.
2. Exercise: Pets require regular exercise, which can help to prevent boredom and physical inactivity. Walking your dog daily is a great way to get both exercise and fresh air.
3. Training: Owning a pet can provide opportunities for training and discipline. Dogs in particular can learn basic commands such as ""sit,"" ""stay,"" ""come,"" and ""heel.""
4. Stress relief: Research has shown that owning a pet can reduce stress and anxiety levels. Petting a cat or dog, for example, can release oxytocin, a hormone that promotes feelings of calm and relaxation.
5. Cheerleader: Pets can provide unconditional love, support, and encouragement when you need it the most. They can also celebrate with you during special occasions such as holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries.

Firefighters, paramedics and police extracted the man from the hole using ropes and ladders due to injuries he sustained to his shoulder and leg.

A man in his 40s was reportedly standing on top of a sewer main when he lost his balance and fell into the open stormwater drain beside Northcott Drive, Meadowbank, at 10.50pm on Wednesday.

Fifteen firefighters spent more than an hour trying to retrieve him from the stormwater pipe, using ropes, hydraulic lifting equipment and Stokes baskets, which are large wicker baskets used to hoist and lower people to and from places underground.

Due to his serious but not life-threatening injuries, including fractures to his pelvis, femur, fibula and ankle, the man was transported to Westmead Hospital in a stable condition.

Supt Cooper said the man's clothing, along with a nearby mattress, may have inflated like airbags when he landed in the drain, causing the fall.

He advised residents and passersby to avoid entering stormwater drains, regardless of whether or not there is visible water inside.

""It's dangerous to be anywhere near a stormwater drain during or after rain because the drains become filled with flowing water and may appear still on the surface,"" he said.

Change4Life, which is being run by Public Health England to help address the country's obesity crisis, is promoting dishes on its website with up to 29g of sugar per serving – about seven teaspoons' worth. Its Apricot Bread Pudding has slightly more sugar than a Snickers bar, which has 27g. A Banana and Apricot Bagel, promoted as a breakfast, has more sugar than a bowl of Frosties – a cereal so sugary Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham once said he would consider banning it. Two other dishes, Banana and Sultana Bread and Butter Pudding, and Banana Muffins, contain 25g per serving. Cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, of campaign group Action On Sugar, said he found the advice 'disturbing' and that Change4Life was 'legitimising unhealthy foods'. He added: 'One has to seriously ask whether Change4Life is fit for purpose when it's promoting foods with shocking levels of sugar.' Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: 'The majority of these recipes are fruit-based. 'Fruit naturally contains sugar – but it is the sugar that is added to food that we eat too much of. Fruit is a healthier choice.' But Dr Malhotra pointed out that recent research had found even fruit sugars could be harmful in large quantities, particularly to those at risk of type 2 diabetes.

"'They may not be much of a match in terms of size - but that proved no obstacle for the budding friendship between this tiny kitten and the Dalmatian who towers over him. Uno, just three weeks old, and Louie, a full-grown dog, were together at home in Spokane, Washington, earlier this month. The clip begins with one of the Pogue family, who recently adopted Uno, tentatively holding him before the two pets are introduced. Adorable: Louie, a full-grown Dalmatian, is shown here snuggling with Uno, a three-week old kitten. After carefully saying hello to Louie's left forepaw, Uno climbs over and settle down between the huge canine's front legs. Louie then shifts his position, giving Uno the chance to nuzzle and lick his neck, before settling down underneath one of his floppy ears. After Uno noses his way forward so the two creatures' faces are side by side, Louie turns his head and nuzzle his new companion lovingly. Throughout the exchange Louie's mother, whom the family adopted at the same time as the kitten, looks on approvingly. According to the Pogue family, their dog has a great track record with kittens. When they have adopted young animals previously, a hug with the Dalmatian has been a rite of passage as they join the family. Getting to know you: Inquisitive Uno pokes his way around his much larger friend's body, and eventually settles under his floppy ear.

"'Sometimes strong-willed children can prove a challenge to parents, especially when it comes to doing what they're told. And that's certainly the case in one household, as a new video shows. Little Catalina from America was filmed emptying out the contents of the kitchen cabinets at home. But when her father tells her to clean up her mess, she vehemently refuses with a heated - and rather cute - argument ensuing. Standing in a frilly skirt with her arms crossed, Catalina answers back at her father in a bid to get him to do the cleaning. 'I already cleaned the kitchen, no it's your turn, I'm not picking up your mess,' her elder firmly responds. As the argument goes on, the volume gets higher and higher.

Sometimes children have a strong opinion about how things should be done, especially when it comes to doing what their parents tell them. This is certainly true for one little girl named Catalina who was recently filmed while she was putting away the kitchen utensils. You see, Catalina had been emptying the cabinet doors before her father instructed her to clean it up. When he told her to clean up her mess, she refused because she thought it was unfair for her to do all the work. She argued with her father for a while until she realized that she could not win the argument. So, she picked up two pans and started to walk away with them. Her father followed her and asked her to put the pans down. She did, but she also continued to refuse to do what her father said. Ultimately, her father gave up and left, which left Catalina alone to deal with the mess. The camera person couldn't help but laugh at Catalina's stubbornness.

The man drops down on one knee as he proposes to his girlfriend inside a McDonald's restaurant. Egged on by his friends, the man, known only as Chase, strides purposefully over to his girlfriend, who is wearing her uniform, and drops down on one knee.

"'Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.' ","##### Sure, here's a summary of the key points from the provided text:

\- Babies who received antibiotics in the first six months of life were more likely to be overweight or obese as toddlers, according to a study published by the Pediatrics medical journal.
\- The study involved more than 12,000 healthy 2-year-olds in Finland and compared their weight and height with records of antibiotic prescription.
\- At 2 years old, about 20% of boys and 10% of girls were overweight or obese.
\- Children who received antibiotics before 6 months of age or repeatedly between 6 months and 2 years were more likely to be overweight or obese.
\- The study suggested that antibiotics may contribute to infant obesity by affecting the balance of bacteria in the gut, which can affect metabolism and nutrient absorption.
\- Given the widespread use of antibiotics, the study authors advised caution in prescribing them, especially in infants, to prevent further increases in obesity rates.

"'This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers. The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on 'a young man falling over while doing his job'.

"'(CNN)One of the biggest TV events of all time is being reimagined for new audiences. ""Roots,"" the epic miniseries about an African-American slave and his descendants, had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977. Now A&E networks are remaking the miniseries, to air in 2016. A&E, Lifetime and History (formerly the History Channel) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte, an African who was captured, shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation. LeVar Burton, who portrayed Kinte in the original, will co-executive produce the new miniseries. A press release describes the new version as ""original"" and ""contemporary"" and will draw more from Alex Haley's classic novel, ""Roots: The Saga of an American Family."" Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity. ""We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original, as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time,"" said Dirk Hoogstra, History's executive vice president and general manager. ""Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte's indomitable spirit."" Executive producer Mark Wolper, son of the original's producer David L. Wolper, added, ""Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage, to Alex Haley, to my father, and now the mantle rests with me. Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again, so must we."" The remade ""Roots"" will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation's first African-American president and ""12 Years a Slave"" win the Oscar for Best Picture, but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities. ""My career began with 'Roots' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation,"" said Burton. ""There is a huge audience of contemporary young Americans who do not know the story of 'Roots' or its importance.""' ","##### Human: ##### How does one go about creating a mobile app?

"'Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy, it was revealed yesterday. Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered. The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me, holding me in the chair. Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence ‘They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room.’ Afterwards, Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet. A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House – so he packed his bags immediately. Mr Lawler, a former Port of Liverpool police officer, said he was ‘haunted’ by the incident for years. After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace, but was twice rebuffed. Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard. A retired royal aide, who is now in his 80s, was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time. Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work ‘exhaustively and co-operatively’ with any police probe. A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment ‘as investigations continue’.' ","#####
Response #####

This is very interesting and disturbing news. I'm sorry to hear that you had such a harrowing experience during your first day on the job. It's clear that the people at Clarence House valued their reputation more than the well-being of their employee. This type of behavior is unacceptable in today's society.

It's commendable that you stood up for yourself and refused to let others bully you. However, it's disheartening to learn that you were discouraged from reporting the incident. Sexual harassment is never acceptable, no matter who is involved.

Thank you for sharing your story. I hope that the Palace takes this incident seriously and investigates the allegations thoroughly. Harassment and discrimination have no place in the workplace or in any social setting.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to support you.

"'An Oregon couple announced they are expecting a child in a rap video they made set to the theme  from '90s television sitcom 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.' The clip, which features Jesse and Melissa Meek rapping as they drive in a car, has been viewed over 1.7 million times on YouTube. 'In Happy Valley, Oregon, livin' it wed, bought our first house and started to build our homestead,' Melissa says in the clip. Parents: Jesse and Melissa Meek announced they are expecting a child in a video set to the theme song from '90s television sitcom 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' The original song for the popular NBC sitcom, sung by star Will Smith, details how his character grew up in West Philadelphia, where he got into a neighborhood fight - and at his mother's insistence, moved to his aunt and uncle's home in their wealthy Los Angeles neighborhood. In the Meeks' parody video, Melissa raps, 'When our family and friends, who were up to no good, started asking questions about parenthood. 'We told one little lie, said ""It's not time yet."" Parents said ""We're ready for grandkids, get a move on it!""' Jesse raps that the couple thought it would take longer than the two months the pair spent trying to conceive. Melissa says in the video 'I woke up in the morning about 7 or 8 and I thought to myself, ""Oh man, I'm late!"" Looked at the test and it was finally there. The little plus sign. We're now three. Not a pair.' At the end of the video, the Meeks smile and share a sonogram of their unborn child. It took five takes to film the clip, the couple told KPTV. After finding out the gender of the child, another video is a possibility for the Meeks, the couple told the Fox affiliate. Original: Will Smith is seen here rapping the theme for 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' during the show's title sequence Big reveal: At the end of the clip, the Meeks share a sonogram of their unborn child According to KPTV, the video was made so loved ones living far away could know about the baby. Melissa told the Fox affliate of the video's success 'It was completely unexpected. Like, that was the last thing we thought would happen, that it would blow up to what it had, or what it has.' Jesse told the Oregonian 'It has been a lot of fun, but definitely way more than we ever expected.' He is the great-great-grandson of Oregon pioneer Joseph Lafayette Meek, the newspaper reported. The Oregonian reported that Melissa earlier made a video which captured Jesse's reaction when he found out about the pregnancy. Jesse learned the news after reading a tag Melissa placed on their dog, which indicated a baby was on the way. A Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, couple made a pregnancy announcement video using 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' theme song last year and recreated the show's title sequence, People reported.'

The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said.

The US  were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta, meaning they were relegated to World Group II. American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1's power proved to be too much 'Today has been a big eye opener,' Williams said afterwards. 'I'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was. Now I'm in the mindset of, ""You know what, I'm not on hard court."" I'm playing like I'm on hard court and I'm not. 'So I have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary.' Williams, 33, won her 19th singles grand slam at the Australian Open and her dominance has raised talk of her claiming all the majors this year. The French Open has been her least successful of the four though despite claiming the title in Paris in 2002 and 2013. Her doubles defeat on Sunday blotted an otherwise flawless Fed Cup record and left the US facing a battle to get back amongst the elite nations next year.

"'(CNN)Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported. Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported. The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. ""Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,"" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an ""act of terrorism."" ""The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,"" the government said in a statement Wednesday. If the militants entered Pakistan after the attack, ""they will be apprehended and brought to justice,"" it said.' ","##### #####

"'(CNN)The classic video game ""Space Invaders"" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. ""When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,"" Nakatani said. He continued: ""They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth."" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as ""among the most respected men in sports-entertainment"" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

"'Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.' ","##### Arrested

"'The dismissal of Paul Downton as England's managing director may be the big talking point in English cricket but focus has already shifted to the start of the county championship season. However, you don't have to go to far before talk returns to the England team again as Kevin Pietersen cut a range of emotions as he posed for the Surrey team photo before the start of the new campaign. Pietersen looked in deep thought as he sat right at the end of the team photo, but was otherwise in a jovial mood as a potentially sensational return to the England set-up took a step closer. Kevin Pietersen takes a moment to reflect ahead of a team photo shoot for Surrey The event at the KIA Oval comes before the start of the County Championship season As team-mates turn their attention to other matters, Pietersen looks ahead in deep thought The batsman joked with photographers at the KIA Oval for the photo session, with Surrey set to begin their campaign at Glamorgan on April 19. Downton's sacking on Wednesday has paved the way for the 34-year-old to return to the international set-up having been controversially axed by the former managing director in 2014. It was during the last Ashes tour for England in Australia last year when Pietersen last featured at international level, in a disastrous trip which saw his side suffer a whitewash series defeat.

"'Relegation-threatened Romanian club Ceahlaul Piatra Neamt have sacked Brazilian coach Ze Maria for the second time in a week. Former Brazil defender Ze Maria was fired on Wednesday after a poor run, only to be reinstated the next day after flamboyant owner Angelo Massone decided to 'give the coaching staff another chance.' But the 41-year-old former Inter Milan and Parma right back, capped 25 times by Brazil, angered Massone again after Ceahlaul were beaten 2-0 by mid-table FC Botosani on Saturday. Ze Maria represented Brazil on 25 occasions during an international career spanning five years The result left Ceahlaul 16th in the standings, six points adrift of safety. Ze Maria replaced Florin Marin in January to become Ceahlaul's third coach this season. He will be replaced by Serbian Vanya Radinovic.' ","#####
## Summary
#####
Romanian soccer club Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț has fired its head coach Ze Maria for the second time this month. However, the dismissal process was stopped due to the intervention of the club's new president, Angelo Massone, who ""gave the coaching staff another chance.""

The former Brazil international was appointed as the new coach of Ceahlăul Piatra Neamţ earlier this year, with a contract until June 2023. After losing the first two rounds of the league against local rivals Dinamo and Sheriff, the club managed to turn the situation around under the guidance of Ze Maria, winning seven out of eight matches played, which placed them from 15th to 7th place in a matter of weeks.

However, things took a different turn for the worse since the last round of the competition, when Ceahlăul lost against the team ranked 10 in the standing, thus regressing to the 16th place. This is also the rank they hold currently.

In light of the recent events, Angelo Massone, the new president of Ceahlăul Piatra Neamţ, decided to give Ze Maria another opportunity to turn the club"," Romanian soccer club Ceahlăul Piatra Neamț fired head coach Ze Maria for the second time this month. | True |

"'New Zealand police are appealing to the public to help identify a man who robbed a Christchurch dairy wearing a 'distinctive' cartoon mask. The offender, snapped on security footage in a fluoro orange sweatshirt and oversized  mask, is described as being 'very tall'. He made off with the dairy's till and about $1500 in cash on Saturday, Stuff.co.nz reports. A man in a 'distinctive' cartoon mask demanded cash from owner's daughter on Saturday Police were reportedly called to the Union St dairy, in east Christchurch at about 12.30pm, after receiving reports of a masked man demanding cash from the dairy owner's daughter. Christina Chen told reporters her 30-year-old daughter ran out of the shop screaming 'robber!'. The masked man threw the cash register to the ground and took off with the till drawer and up to $1,500. 'Normally they just rob cigarettes and some more things, it's not a big issue,' Chen told Stuff.co.nz. 'But this time they were scary because they wore a mask, and we don't know who it is.' Police say there were no signs of any weapons used but that the robber remained at large. They are asking anyone with information that may help to identify this person to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or to message police online.'

"'Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her. A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action. 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'' ","##### Arrested for Seducing Student #####

"'A video of a menacing crocodile swimming through a public marina with a dead pet dog locked in between its jaws has been viewed more than half a million times online. The clip shows a large croc calmly moving through the marina in the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta, in Mexico, with a black dog wearing a red collar lifeless in its mouth. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages, not moving at all'. Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop's owner. Scroll down for video The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina, in Mexico 'There's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river (200m away) which runs out to the sea and the marina,' Mr Weston explained. 'The dog went to the water's edge to see the crocodile (being curious I guess) but things didn't go according to plan obviously. 'It was certainly a shock to the system. Guess that's nature though,' he said. In the video the beast glides through the water, with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other, as crowds gasp in amazement. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when he saw the alarming sight Tourist Tim Weston took a photo of the crocodile with the dog between its jaws A video of the crocodile swimming through the marina with the bike shop owner's dog has been viewed more than 500,000 times Mr Weston said: 'A couple of hours later we walked back past and there was still a crowd... But we didn't want to look at it again as we had just eaten. Yesterday morning there was no sign of either.' Social media users have reacted in horror to the video that was posted on the Bogged Facebook page. One woman  called the video 'horrible' and another said 'I hate crocodiles now'. But crocodiles are a common site in Puerto Vallarta as the Mexican beach resort is built amongst the mangroves that the creatures have called home for centuries. As well as living in the nearby sanctuary, crocs are regularly spotted on the resort's golf course. In Mexico the 'American Crocodiles' can reach lengths of 6 meters and as a result of urbanisation are living closer to humans than ever before. One social media user called the video 'horrible' and another said 'I hate crocodiles now'' ","##### Responses #####

We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all.

"'A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.' ","#####

"'The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday. While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.' ","##### Human: ##### What does ""laze"" mean?

"'Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has reminded Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe about their professional responsibilities and urged them to learn from a chastening week. Sterling, the England international who will lead Liverpool’s line at Wembley on Sunday in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge, was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday. Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes. Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (left) hasn't disciplined Sterling (pictured) or Ibe for the incident Ibe was present among the Reds squad during their training session on Friday ahead of their FA Cup semi Rodgers, who has Steven Gerrard available for the FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, spoke to Sterling and Ibe in his office on Thursday but neither will be disciplined and Rodgers now wants to draw a line under the matter. He said: ‘It is understanding that when you are a professional, elite sportsperson, there are things you can and cannot be doing and be seen to be doing. ‘It’s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities. ‘It is difficult. Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and I’m not talking about this instance — (but) how it gets framed is totally different.’ Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign. They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress.

"'Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf.

Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing.

Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence.

Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’.

"'(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.' ","#####

"'First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series.

""We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal,"" they wrote. They go on to say: ""We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives.

"'(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: ""Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival."" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to ""reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred."" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.' ","#####SECONDARY OBJECTS###

The preceding passage tells us about the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket that carries a SpaceX capsule into space. However, the rocket itself does not reach the desired target. Instead, the upper portion of the rocket (i.e., the payload) separates from the rocket and falls into the atmosphere, while the lower portion of the rocket continues toward the target. Once the lower portion of the rocket reaches the targeted area, it uses a series of fins and engines to maneuver itself into position to impact the surface of the planet.

In order to achieve a controlled descent and impact with the surface, the rocket must be able to slow down and maneuver itself. To do this, the rocket releases a large amount of fuel at the very last moment. This fuel is used to create drag as the rocket hits the surface of the planet. Because there is so much fuel released, the rocket becomes a ""secondary object"" and moves forward after separating from the main body.

In conclusion, the passage provides an overview of the process of launching objects into space and how the resulting secondary objects behave during their return to Earth.

"'Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places. Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net. Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November.'

"'Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch. But that doesn’t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid  a stroke. Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera, Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage. The fish begins relaxing in the man's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man’s fingers. The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation. Repeating the process, the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man’s hand to be stroked again. Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers. The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more. The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish, clearly saddened by this, following it up to the surface of the water. According to Mr Giroux, who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel, the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish. The fish swims away from the man's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet. He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable. After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn’t play with it on a daily basis. The fish begins swimming around the man's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day. The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986.' ","###Roland Giroux###
A man named Roland Giroux has a fascinating relationship with his fish. In particular, his blood parrot cichlid. This unique species of fish has two distinct personalities, one where it is aggressive and the other where it is friendly.

Giroux noticed that whenever the blood parrot cichlid behaved aggressively, it had a red coloration in its fins. However, when it behaved friendlier, its fins turned yellow.

He decided to take care of the fish after it was abandoned in a community garden. Since then, he has spent hours daily playing, feeding, and caring for it. Giroux even massages the fish's body with his hands!

In return, the fish shows its affection by swimming around Giroux's hand, nibbling at his fingers, and even trying to kiss him. It's clear that this special bond between human and animal is unlike any other.

When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said: ‘Mind that locker, Stokesey.’ It was here, of course, that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team. Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team Stokes (left) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England But Stokes (right) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs. I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who cannot capture the imagination. He has something about him, as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson’s face during the Ashes series. He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return. But I do believe he will need careful man-managing. Peter Moores, England’s coach, dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right. The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on. England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on. It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad. What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed. He can be feisty and fiery as long as it’s natural but his aggression has to be controlled. You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets. Stokes (second left) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team Stokes (left) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally. There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible. This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game. They can only get better and that’s an exciting prospect.' ","###########

It is understood the Wales squad prefer to play at the Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium There had been speculation that Wales would play Belgium at the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium with so much interest in the match. But that was never going to happen as UEFA rules prevent the venue being changed within 120 days of the scheduled date. It is understood Gareth Bale and company would prefer playing at the more intimate Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium, where they have not played since meeting England in a Euro 2012 qualifier in March 2011.'

'Manchester City are keen to sign Anderlecht teenager Evangelos Patoulidis. The 14-year-old playmaker is regarded as one of the best talents to emerge from Anderlecht's youth set-up and has also attracted attention from Arsenal and Barcelona. The Belgian starlet rejected a move to Barcelona's La Masia academy when he was 12 as his family wanted him to continue his studies. He has continued to impress and City have held discussions with Anderlecht chairman Roger Vanden Stock in the hope of agreeing a compensation package.

> Manchester City is interested in signing 14-year old teenage midfielder, Evangelos Patoulidis, who plays for Anderlecht's youth team. The youngster has already attracted interest from other top European clubs including Barcelona and Arsenal.

Patoulidis' exceptional skills have caught the eye of many elite teams, and it is believed that City are very serious about trying to sign him. The Belgium club, Anderlecht, are willing to negotiate on the player's price and they may be open to accepting an offer made by City. However, they want a transfer fee of around €5 million, which may prove to be too rich for Pep Guardiola's side to pay.

Manuel Pellegrini is looking to rebuild his squad over the summer, and signing Patoulidis could be seen as a smart long-term investment. The young Greek-Cypriot has been described as one of the most promising prospects to come out of Anderlecht's youth academy in years, and if City can pull off this deal, it would be a major coup for the club.

City fans will be hoping that the club can secure the signing of Patoulidis, as he could become a star of the"," Manchester City is interested in signing 14-year old teenage midfielder, Evangelos Patoulidis, who plays for Anderlecht's youth team. | True |

"'A woman who suffered seven miscarriages has spoken of her distress after a family friend stole the money set aside for her babies' grave stone. The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said:  'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury. 'That was Daniel James and the £207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost £500 altogether. 'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted to do for Daniel James was put a head stone on him so he knew how much his mummy and daddy loved him. I feel betrayed, horrible. You try and do a good gesture to people and then you get it thrown in your face.' Tears: She then burst into tears and rushed off the stage - pursued by the Jeremy Kyle cameras Sobbing: She was comforted by her partner, also called Jamie, after the show' ","#####

"'(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.' ","##### Human: ##### What is the difference between men's and women's lacrosse?

Players can push off using the bottom of their feet to get around a defender but they cannot hold or use their body to keep the opposing player at bay. ##### Futher Questions: ##### Can you tell me about the history of both sports?

"'Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid.

East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

"'Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility.

"'Last week she was barely showing – but Demelza Poldark is now the proud mother to the show’s latest addition. Within ten minutes of tomorrow night’s episode, fans will see Aidan Turner’s dashing Ross Poldark gaze lovingly at his new baby daughter. As Sunday night’s latest heartthrob, women across the country have voiced their longing to settle down with the brooding Cornish gentleman – but unfortunately it seems as if his heart is well and truly off the market. Scroll down for video Last week she was barely showing – but Demelza Poldark is now the proud mother to the show’s latest addition He may have married his red-headed kitchen maid out of duty, but as he tells her that she makes him a better man, audiences can have little doubt about his feelings. What is rather less convincing, however, is the timeline of the pregnancy. With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow’s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant. Just minutes after – once again without any nod to the passing of time – she is giving birth, with the last month of her pregnancy passing in less than the blink of an eye.

One posted on Twitter: ‘If you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes’ It is reminiscent of the show’s previous pregnancy that saw Elizabeth, another contender for Ross’s affection, go to full term in the gap between two episodes. This didn’t go unnoticed by fans, who posted on Twitter: ‘Poldark is rather good, would watch the next one now. Though if you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes.’' ","##### Sure! Here's a summary of the passage: ##### ##### In the seventh season of the television series, Poldark, Demelza Poldark is expecting a child with Ross Poldark. However, the pregnancy is rushed due to the sudden announcement of the pregnancy in the previous episode. The eighth episode of the season begins with Demelza's pregnancy, which has suddenly progressed without any indication of the passing of time. Within minutes, Demelza gives birth to a baby girl. This rapid pregnancy and delivery contrast with the more natural pacing of earlier seasons, which had taken months or even years to develop. ##### ##### This unexpected plot twist was criticized by some viewers, who felt that the writers were trying too hard to keep up the momentum of the story. Others believed that the quickening of the pregnancy was a reflection of modern expectations, where babies are often born much sooner after conception than they would have been in the late 18th century. Regardless of the reason for the accelerated pregnancy, the rapid delivery leaves the audience and other characters in the show equally surprised and delighted.

"'(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for ""Barbara,"" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the ""warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions."" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited ""three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,"" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. ""For her to go to Mexico,"" Mate said, ""It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from."" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to ""navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,"" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. ""Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,"" Mate said. Fourth baby orca born this season' ","#####

"'Outspoken MP Bob Katter has risked being drawn into a race row after accusing the Queensland Government of believing embattled MP Billy Gordon was 'a little black puppet on a string'. In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past. Mr Katter, federal MP for Kennedy, is of Lebanese descent. He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos. 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?' Mr Katter's statement reads. 'I can't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string. Mr Gordon, who  was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology.

Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.'

The teenager says her motivation for creating the video was to counteract stereotypes held by people over certain disabilities. 'People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' she added. 'I might do things a little bit differently than most people, but that doesn't mean that I should be treated differently.' This is one of several videos that Dayna has created. Last year the teenager produced another dancing clip with her strutting her stuff to Taylor Swift's Shake It Off.

People just look at me and think, oh that's just the girl with cerebral palsy,' she said. 'I would like people to look past that and be like, oh she's just one of us.' Dayna says she wanted to turn any negativity that might be held over her disability into something positive and hopefully inspire others, or at the very least raise a smile. 'When I was first diagnosed with cerebral palsy, doctors warned my parents that I may never walk, but here I am dancing! I drive, I go to college, I do things like every other 19-year-old,' she says.

"'A southern Iowa chiropractor accused of accepting sex as payment for his services and performing exorcisms on patients has surrendered his state license. The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While Maneul has received just three patient survey responses on HealthGrades.com, those responses were quite positive. The disgraced chiropractor received a perfect five out of five stars in patient satisfaction. Strange practice: Charles Manuel, who admitted wrongdoing to the Iowa Board of Chiropractic, listed his practice's addresses on this residential street in the small agricultural town of Lamoni in southern Iowa' ","##### Sure #####

"'The man who allegedly killed his neighbour was believed to be suffering from dementia and alcohol abuse at the time of the horrendous murder in 2012, a jury has heard. Luigi Costa, 71, is accused of stomping on his elderly neighbour Terrence Freebody's head, cutting his throat and stabbing him multiple times in the dining room of his home on Mugga Way in Red Hill, Canberra on July 2012. Forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen examined Costa after the attack and believes there was evidence of the accused's state of mind declining in the lead-up to the incident and also during the event, The ABC reported. Luigi Costa, 71, is accused of killing his elderly neighbour Terrence Freebody in the dining room of his home on Mugga Way, Red Hill, Canberra in July 2012 Professor Mullin told the court that the triple 0 calls which Costa made 'almost certainly' during the incident proved that his mood fluctuated from 'moment to moment'. He also said the trail of faeces from the crime scene  to the toilet were police found Costa suggested his confused mental state. 'I believe that at the time of the killing Mr Costa's brain was compromised by dementia and when you add to this alcohol that led to a confused state,' he said. 'I do not think you would understand what you were doing in that state or understand the dreadful long-term consequences.' Prosecutor Shane Drumgold suggested that Costa feigned his failing memory while being interviewed by Professor Mullin - who denied these claims. 'My view is that it was more likely than possible that Mr Costa was suffering a demented illness in the weeks, months and possibly years in the lead up to this event,' he said. Costa's state of mind is critical to case, as The jury can return a not guilty verdict  if Costa's unstable mindset at time of the attack can be proven.

"'Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager. Baines (left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it. I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.' Barkley's penalty was well-struck but wasn't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save. Fortunately for the young England player, it didn't prove costly as Mirallas went on to score the only goal of the game after 29 minutes.

"'Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.' ","#####Lasers in sci-fi #####

"'A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.''

"'(CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle ""Shelly"" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. ""This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,"" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. ""It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts."" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.

"'Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing Hull (away) - May 4 Swansea (home) - May 11 Man United (away) - May 17 Sunderland (home) May 20 West Brom (home) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season' ","##### THIRD PLACE IN LA LIGA WITH A PERFORMANCE AWARDED BY FIFA #####

"'A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: ‘I stopped because I couldn’t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.’ Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker.

"'Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.'
