I was correct! There are indeed no elements in the periodic table that contain the letter ""j"", so I responded correctly with ""no response"".assistant

Yes, that's correct! The periodic table consists of 118 known elements, and none of them have the letter ""j"" in their symbol or name. So, it was a valid response to say ""no response"" since there are no elements that meet the specified condition.assistant

There are no 81 countries in the world that end with the letter 'g'. In fact, there are only a few countries that end with the letter 'g', and they are:

Bulg; Fiji; Gambia; Guinea-Bissau; Mongolia; Swazig;

Note: Swaziland officially changed its name to Eswatini in 2018, so it's possible that Swazig is not considered a valid country name anymore.

That's correct! There are no words in the NATO phonetic alphabet that end with the letter 'z'. The NATO phonetic alphabet is a standardized system used to clearly communicate letters and numbers over radio and phone communications, especially in situations where standard letter pronunciation may be unclear. It consists of 26 code words, one for each letter of the alphabet, and none of them end with the letter 'z'.assistant
